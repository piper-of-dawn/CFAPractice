    "explanation": "Start from definitions: a security is “public” if it is registered to trade in public markets and therefore must typically satisfy minimum regulatory standards such as reporting and governance; that makes statement 1 true. A security is “private” if it is not registered for public trading; the reading emphasizes that private securities are generally illiquid and often restricted to specially qualified investors, so statement 4 is true. Statement 2 sounds plausible but is too absolute: the reading says “often” only specially qualified investors can purchase private securities, not “always.” Statement 3 is the opposite of the core point: because private equity is not listed, there is no active secondary market and prices are not continuously market-quoted. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}"

Statement 2 is also aligned with the reading’s idea of avoiding public-market standards, but the question’s option structure forces a single best set; the decisive falsity is statement 3: the text explicitly notes private issuers are typically not required to publish the same information, making valuation information harder to obtain. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}"

    "explanation": "Influence requires visibility: you can only monitor and pressure management if you can observe actions, disclosures, and outcomes. Public companies operate under disclosure regimes and public attention, which enables monitoring by shareholders and analysts; that monitoring changes incentives, pushing openness in governance and compensation. The reading explicitly notes that under public scrutiny companies are incentivized to be more open, and that stakeholders can influence management when policies are public, making the reason a direct explanation. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}"

      "d": "A is false but R is true"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Start from access constraints: if a market is private, participation may be limited, and transaction/monitoring costs can be high. To reduce these frictions, markets often use intermediating structures—funds/vehicles that pool capital and hold private instruments—so investors can participate indirectly rather than negotiating each private deal. The reading states investors may purchase private securities directly from issuers or indirectly through vehicles formed to hold them, and notes eligibility restrictions, so the reason explains the assertion’s two access paths. :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}"
