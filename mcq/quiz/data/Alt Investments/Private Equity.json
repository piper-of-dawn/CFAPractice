    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Start from first principles: “private equity” means an equity (ownership) claim in an enterprise whose shares are not listed for continuous public trading. (1) is therefore correct because the defining feature is non-publicly traded ownership interests. Next, value creation in private equity is not usually passive; owners often influence governance, strategy, capital structure, and operating decisions, so (2) is typically correct. Liquidity requires a deep, standardized, continuous market; while secondary sales exist, they are not generally “active” in the sense of public equities and can be slow, negotiated, and discounted—so (3) is incorrect. Finally, because distributions are commonly back-ended (sale to a strategic buyer, sponsor-to-sponsor sale, IPO, recapitalization), realized returns are primarily tied to exit events, making (4) correct."

(1) is correct because operational efficiency can raise free cash flow via higher revenues, better margins, or lower working-capital needs. (2) is correct because leverage changes the capital structure: if the enterprise value grows and debt is serviced, gains accrue to the smaller equity base, magnifying equity returns (while also increasing risk). (3) is incorrect because “short-term trading gains” requires liquidity and frequent price discovery; private equity’s illiquidity and control-oriented approach typically targets multi-year value creation, not rapid turnover.

(2) is correct because a trade sale is a sale to a strategic buyer (another firm) that often pays for synergies and control. (3) is incorrect because immediate exit would defeat the purpose of operational and strategic improvements; holding periods are typically long enough to execute a value-creation plan and reach an attractive exit market.

(2) is correct because deeper changes—systems upgrades, pricing strategy, add-on acquisitions, talent and incentive redesign—often take years to implement and show up in cash flows. (3) is incorrect because “illiquidity risk” is not eliminated simply by intending to hold for a shorter time; if a market for the stake is still thin, a short intended horizon can actually increase the chance of needing to sell at an unfavorable time or discount.

(2) is correct because performance fees (carried interest) tie a meaningful portion of manager compensation to value creation, aligning incentives toward profitable exits and away from simply growing the fee base. (3) is incorrect because private equity commonly features higher and more complex fees than public mutual funds when considering both management fee and carry.

Reason (R) is true and explains the mechanism: debt creates a fixed claim, so increases in firm value largely flow to the residual claim (equity), magnifying gains on a smaller equity base.
