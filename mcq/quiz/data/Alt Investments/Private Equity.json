      "D": "1, 2, 3 and 4"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Private equity by definition targets non-public companies and relies on control or influence to create value. Because there is no active secondary market, liquidity is low and returns are typically realized only at exit, such as a sale or IPO."

    "correct_answer": "A",
