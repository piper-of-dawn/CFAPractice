    "explanation": "Start from purpose. Traditional long-only funds are usually constrained (eligible assets, leverage limits, benchmark-relative framing). Hedge funds are structured to pursue a return objective using a wider toolkit, so flexibility (1) and tools like shorting, derivatives, and leverage (2) are common. Now tie objective to behavior: “absolute return” means the manager is trying to make money in many environments, not just beat an index in up markets, so (4) fits. Statement (3) contradicts first principles: if your goal is to track an index, you reduce active bets and complexity; hedge funds exist largely to do the opposite—take targeted risks (often hedged) and monetize them, not replicate an index."

A performance fee is “share in value created,” so it scales with gains/profits (2). The economic intent is incentive alignment: the manager earns more when investors earn more, so (4) is true. But incentive alignment is not a guarantee of outcomes: investors can still lose money if the strategy loses, and fees can worsen that, which makes (3) false. The key distinction is mechanism vs guarantee: fees shape behavior by rewarding success, but they cannot override market risk, strategy risk, or drawdowns."

A high-water mark fixes this by setting a reference point: the investor must be made whole back to the prior peak before incentives restart, so (1) and (2) are true.

If many investors redeem quickly, the fund may be forced to sell assets at bad prices (fire sales), harming remaining investors and potentially destabilizing the strategy. Lockups (1) and gates (2) are contractual tools that slow outflows, giving the manager time to unwind positions more orderly and protect the strategy’s economics—this is exactly the forced-sale logic in (3).

Relative value starts with “two things should be priced consistently”; the trade is to buy the cheap leg and sell the rich leg, monetizing convergence (1). Global macro starts with “macro forces move many markets”; the trade expresses directional themes across rates, FX, commodities, equities, etc. (2). Because strategies are built on different economic engines—convergence, carry, volatility, directional macro, corporate events—their sensitivities (rates, spreads, volatility, liquidity) and correlations can vary widely (4). Statement (3) is too strong: event-driven strategies often embrace idiosyncratic event risk (mergers, restructurings, distress); they may hedge some market risk, but “eliminate all idiosyncratic risk” contradicts the core idea."

    "explanation": "Start from mechanics. Leverage is “more exposure per dollar of equity,” so any return shock is scaled up—good or bad—making (1) true. Derivatives often require only margin/premium, so they can deliver meaningful exposure with less initial cash than buying the underlying (2). Because leverage and derivatives can create nonlinear payoffs and large losses in stressed markets, hedge funds emphasize risk controls (limits, VAR/stress tests, liquidity management, hedges) to avoid blowups, supporting (4). Statement (3) is the classic trap: derivatives are tools; risk depends on the position’s sensitivity and structure, not the instrument label. A derivative can reduce risk (hedge) or increase it (levered bet)."

If a fund starts reporting after strong early performance and the database “backfills” that history, the sample again becomes upward biased—backfill bias (2). Coverage matters too: many funds report voluntarily to some databases and not others, so different indexes can represent different slices of the hedge fund universe, producing different reported results (4). Statement (3) is false because hedge funds are not generally exchange-traded like stocks; reporting is often voluntary and uneven, which is exactly why these biases exist."

    "explanation": "Funds are exposed to liquidity mismatch: assets may be hard to sell quickly, but investors may want cash quickly.

    "stem": "Consider the following statements regarding leverage in hedge funds:\n(1) A margin call is initiated when a hedge fund's equity in a position declines below a required level.\n(2) The use of borrowed funds allows investors to take a market position smaller than their capital commitment to reduce risk.\n(3) In a typical margin financing arrangement, the prime broker lends shares or cash to the hedge fund.\nWhich of the statements given above are correct?",
    "options": {
      "A": "1 and 2 only",
      "B": "1 and 3 only",
      "C": "2 and 3 only"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct; a margin call demands additional collateral when the account value falls below a maintenance threshold. Statement (2) is incorrect because leverage allows investors to take a position *larger* than their capital commitment, which magnifies both gains and losses rather than reducing risk. Statement (3) is correct as prime brokers facilitate leverage by lending cash for purchases or securities for short selling. Therefore, only statements (1) and (3) are correct. Options A and C fail because they misstate the purpose and effect of leverage."
