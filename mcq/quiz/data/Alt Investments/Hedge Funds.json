    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Start from purpose. Traditional long-only funds are usually constrained (eligible assets, leverage limits, benchmark-relative framing). Hedge funds are structured to pursue a return objective using a wider toolkit, so flexibility (1) and tools like shorting, derivatives, and leverage (2) are common. Now tie objective to behavior: “absolute return” means the manager is trying to make money in many environments, not just beat an index in up markets, so (4) fits. Statement (3) contradicts first principles: if your goal is to track an index, you reduce active bets and complexity; hedge funds exist largely to do the opposite—take targeted risks (often hedged) and monetize them, not replicate an index."

    "explanation": "Build from definitions. A management fee is “pay for managing the pool,” so it scales with AUM (1). A performance fee is “share in value created,” so it scales with gains/profits (2). The economic intent is incentive alignment: the manager earns more when investors earn more, so (4) is true. But incentive alignment is not a guarantee of outcomes: investors can still lose money if the strategy loses, and fees can worsen that, which makes (3) false. The key distinction is mechanism vs guarantee: fees shape behavior by rewarding success, but they cannot override market risk, strategy risk, or drawdowns."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Start from the problem: without constraints, a manager could earn incentive fees in good years, lose money in bad years, then earn incentive fees again just for recovering back to where investors previously were—investors would effectively pay twice for the same wealth level. A high-water mark fixes this by setting a reference point: the investor must be made whole back to the prior peak before incentives restart, so (1) and (2) are true. This also improves intertemporal alignment: it rewards net new wealth creation, not mere bounce-backs, supporting (4). Statement (3) confuses fee mechanics with investment outcomes: high-water marks change when fees are paid; they do not remove market risk or prevent drawdowns."

    "explanation": "Begin with a simple balance-sheet view: a fund holds assets; investors hold claims on the fund; redemptions are cash outflows. If many investors redeem quickly, the fund may be forced to sell assets at bad prices (fire sales), harming remaining investors and potentially destabilizing the strategy. Lockups (1) and gates (2) are contractual tools that slow outflows, giving the manager time to unwind positions more orderly and protect the strategy’s economics—this is exactly the forced-sale logic in (3). Statement (4) reverses the meaning: these terms reduce liquidity (investor flexibility) in exchange for better asset-liability matching and protection against runs."

Relative value starts with “two things should be priced consistently”; the trade is to buy the cheap leg and sell the rich leg, monetizing convergence (1). Global macro starts with “macro forces move many markets”; the trade expresses directional themes across rates, FX, commodities, equities, etc. (2). Because strategies are built on different economic engines—convergence, carry, volatility, directional macro, corporate events—their sensitivities (rates, spreads, volatility, liquidity) and correlations can vary widely (4). Statement (3) is too strong: event-driven strategies often embrace idiosyncratic event risk (mergers, restructurings, distress); they may hedge some market risk, but “eliminate all idiosyncratic risk” contradicts the core idea."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Start from mechanics. Leverage is “more exposure per dollar of equity,” so any return shock is scaled up—good or bad—making (1) true. Derivatives often require only margin/premium, so they can deliver meaningful exposure with less initial cash than buying the underlying (2). Because leverage and derivatives can create nonlinear payoffs and large losses in stressed markets, hedge funds emphasize risk controls (limits, VAR/stress tests, liquidity management, hedges) to avoid blowups, supporting (4). Statement (3) is the classic trap: derivatives are tools; risk depends on the position’s sensitivity and structure, not the instrument label. A derivative can reduce risk (hedge) or increase it (levered bet)."

    "explanation": "Start from sampling: an index is only as good as the dataset feeding it. If losing funds stop reporting or disappear, the remaining sample is biased upward—survivorship bias (1). If a fund starts reporting after strong early performance and the database “backfills” that history, the sample again becomes upward biased—backfill bias (2). Coverage matters too: many funds report voluntarily to some databases and not others, so different indexes can represent different slices of the hedge fund universe, producing different reported results (4). Statement (3) is false because hedge funds are not generally exchange-traded like stocks; reporting is often voluntary and uneven, which is exactly why these biases exist."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "“Absolute return” means the target is a positive return level (or positive performance) rather than “index + alpha.” The reason explains the behavioral implication: managers use flexible tools (hedging, shorting, derivatives, dynamic exposures) to try to perform in different regimes. This doesn’t guarantee profits, but it explains why the label is used and how it differs from benchmark-relative management."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The core principle is fairness over time: investors should pay performance fees on net wealth creation, not on a round trip back to an earlier level. The reason is the mechanism: “previous peak” is the hurdle, so fees restart only after the investor is made whole and then earns additional gains. This improves long-run alignment because it ties incentive pay to cumulative progress, not just annual fluctuations."

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Funds are exposed to liquidity mismatch: assets may be hard to sell quickly, but investors may want cash quickly. The reason describes the run-prevention logic: slowing withdrawals reduces fire-sale pressure and the negative spillover to investors who stay. The trade-off is straightforward: investors give up some liquidity in exchange for better protection of asset value under stress."

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Leverage is a multiplier: it scales portfolio sensitivities, so losses accelerate when markets move against you. The reason adds the second-order mechanism: when equity falls, lenders/margin requirements can force position reductions at bad times, which can deepen losses. This is why hedge funds emphasize risk controls around leverage, liquidity, and stress scenarios rather than treating leverage as a free return booster."
