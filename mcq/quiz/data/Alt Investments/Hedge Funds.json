    "question": "A hedge fund has assets under management (AUM) of $250 million and charges a 2% annual management fee. What is the annual management fee?",
    "answer": "$5,000,000",
    "explanation": "Start from first principles: a management fee is an annual charge that is proportional to the size of the fund (its AUM). “Proportional” means: fee = (rate) × (base). Here the base is AUM because the manager is paid for managing a pool of assets, independent of whether returns were great or terrible. Convert the percent to a decimal: 2% = 0.02. Multiply by AUM: 0.02 × 250,000,000 = 5,000,000. Intuition check: 1% of $250m is $2.5m, so 2% should be $5m. This matches the calculation."

    "answer": "$8,000,000",
    "explanation": "First principles: a performance fee is a share of the value (wealth) the manager creates, so its base is profits (or gains), not AUM. So the formula is: performance fee = (performance-fee rate) × (profits). Convert 20% to decimal: 0.20. Multiply: 0.20 × 40,000,000 = 8,000,000. Sanity check: 10% of $40m is $4m; doubling to 20% gives $8m. This aligns with the idea that the manager’s variable compensation rises when investor wealth rises."

    "answer": "$4,000,000",
    "explanation": "Break it into two independent fee engines. (1) Management fee depends only on AUM: 2% × $100m = 0.02 × 100,000,000 = 2,000,000. (2) Performance fee depends only on profits: 20% × $10m = 0.20 × 10,000,000 = 2,000,000. Total fees are additive because they are two separate charges: total = 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 4,000,000.

    "answer": "8%",
    "explanation": "Start with what “gross return” means: it is the return before fees. Gross profit = 12% of $50m = 0.12 × 50,000,000 = 6,000,000. Now apply fees as defined: (1) Management fee = 2% of AUM = 0.02 × 50,000,000 = 1,000,000. This is charged because the fund managed $50m over the year. (2) Performance fee = 20% of profits (the wealth created) = 0.20 × 6,000,000 = 1,200,000. Net profit to investors = gross profit − management fee − performance fee = 6,000,000 − 1,000,000 − 1,200,000 = 3,800,000. Convert net profit back into a return on starting AUM: 3,800,000 / 50,000,000 = 0.076 = 7.6%. Rounding to the nearest whole percent gives 8%."

    "question": "A hedge fund uses 2:1 leverage (2× exposure). If the underlying assets return +5% before fees, what is the fund’s approximate return before fees?",
    "answer": "10%",
    "explanation": "First principles: leverage means you control more exposure than your own capital by borrowing or using financing. A simple way to reason is: exposure return ≈ leverage × underlying return, when we ignore borrowing costs and nonlinear effects. With 2× leverage, for every $1 of investor capital, the fund has about $2 of market exposure. If the assets rise 5%, the gain on the $2 exposure is 0.05 × 2 = 0.10, or 10% of the investor’s $1 capital. That’s the mechanical magnification: leverage scales gains and losses. Reality can differ if financing costs exist, but the core principle—more exposure per unit capital—drives the scaling."

    "question": "A hedge fund uses 3:1 leverage (3× exposure). If the underlying assets return −4% before fees, what is the fund’s approximate return before fees?",
    "answer": "−12%",
    "explanation": "Same mechanism as gains, but applied to losses. Leverage does not ‘know’ direction; it amplifies whatever happens. With 3× exposure, the fund is effectively holding $3 of assets per $1 of investor capital. A −4% move on $3 exposure produces −0.04 × 3 = −0.12, which is −12% on investor capital. This is why the curriculum highlights leverage as an important characteristic: it increases risk exposure and can produce large drawdowns from moderate adverse moves."

    "question": "A hedge fund has AUM of $150 million and returns −5% gross for the year. The management fee is 2% of AUM. Ignoring performance fees, how much management fee is paid?",
    "answer": "$3,000,000",
    "explanation": "First principles: the management fee is tied to AUM, not profits. The economic idea is ‘pay for service’ (running the fund) rather than ‘pay for success.’ Therefore the return being negative does not eliminate the management fee. Compute it directly: 2% = 0.02, and 0.02 × 150,000,000 = 3,000,000. A quick mental check: 1% of $150m is $1.5m, so 2% is $3m. This also connects to why performance fees are considered the incentive component, whereas management fees are the stable component."

    "question": "A hedge fund starts the year with $200 million AUM and earns a 6% net return (after fees). Assuming no investor inflows/outflows, what is ending AUM?",
    "answer": "$212,000,000",
    "explanation": "First principles: AUM is just the current dollar value of the assets managed. If no money enters or leaves (no flows), AUM changes only by investment return. A 6% net return means the fund value grows by 6% of the starting value. So ending AUM = starting AUM × (1 + net return) = 200,000,000 × 1.06 = 212,000,000. Intuition: 10% of 200m is 20m; 5% is 10m; 6% is 12m. Add 12m to 200m = 212m."

    "answer": "4.5%",
    "explanation": "First principles: an equal-weighted index means each constituent fund contributes the same weight, regardless of size. With four funds, each weight is 1/4. The index return is the average: (4% + 6% + 10% − 2%) / 4. Sum first: 4 + 6 = 10; 10 + 10 = 20; 20 − 2 = 18. Divide by 4: 18/4 = 4.5%.

    "explanation": "First principles: an asset-weighted index weights constituents by their assets, because the index is measuring the return on the average dollar invested in the database. Total AUM = 80 + 20 = 100. Weights: Fund 1 weight = 80/100 = 0.8; Fund 2 weight = 20/100 = 0.2. Weighted return = 0.8×5% + 0.2×15% = 4% + 3% = 7%.

    "answer": "20%",
    "explanation": "First principles: a rate is “part divided by whole.” Here, the fee is the part and profits are the whole base. Rate = fee / profits = 6,000,000 / 30,000,000 = 0.20. Convert to percent: 0.20 = 20%. This is the inverse of the usual fee computation and reinforces the definition: performance fee is a proportion of wealth created."

    "question": "A hedge fund earns a 9% gross return. Total fees paid (management + performance) equal 3% of starting AUM. What is the net return?",
    "answer": "6%",
    "explanation": "First principles: return is change in value divided by starting value. If fees are expressed as a percent of starting AUM, they directly reduce the investor’s return, dollar-for-dollar relative to that same base. So net return = gross return − fee drag = 9% − 3% = 6%. This simplified approach works because both gross return and fees are measured against the same base (starting AUM). If fee bases differed (e.g., performance fee on profits), you would compute dollars first and then divide by AUM, but the concept is identical: investor keeps what remains after fees."

    "answer": "7.5%",
    "explanation": "Work from primitives: AUM is the base pool; profit is the dollar gain created; fees are claims against that gain or against the pool. Step 1: management fee = 0.02 × 120,000,000 = 2,400,000. Step 2: performance fee = 0.20 × 15,000,000 = 3,000,000. Step 3: net profit to investors = 15,000,000 − 2,400,000 − 3,000,000 = 9,600,000. Step 4: net return = net profit / starting AUM = 9,600,000 / 120,000,000 = 0.08 = 8%. If you instead interpret the performance fee as applied to profits before management fee, this 8% is consistent. If your convention applied performance fee after management fee (not stated in the PDF excerpt), the numeric would shift. Using the direct “profits base” definition given, 8% is the clean first-principles result."

    "answer": "10%",
    "explanation": "First principles: an index based on voluntary reporting only includes the funds that choose to report. “Reported average” means you average over the included set, not the true universe. Here, only eight funds remain in the reporting database and their average is given as +10%. Therefore the reported average return is +10%.

Eight funds return +10% each, contributing 8×10% = 80% total. Two funds return −20% each, contributing 2×(−20%) = −40% total. Combine: 80% − 40% = 40% total across 10 funds. Divide by 10: 40%/10 = 4%. This shows the mechanics of survivorship bias: reported (10%) can be much higher than true (4%) when underperformers disappear from the dataset."

    "answer": "1,780 funds",
    "explanation": "First principles: when you combine two sets, you must avoid double counting the overlap. The combined distinct count = A + B − overlap. Here: 1,000 + 900 − 120 = 1,780. This ties directly to the curriculum point that many funds report to only one database, so overlaps can be small—leading different indexes to represent different slices of the hedge fund world."

Percentage = 120/1,000 = 0.12 = 12%.

    "explanation": "First principles: a performance gap in percentage points is simple subtraction of returns expressed in percent, not a ratio. Gap = 8% − 3% = 5 percentage points.

    "explanation": "First principles: leverage is a multiplier that converts capital into exposure. Exposure is the amount of assets the fund is effectively long/short in the market. If leverage is 2.5×, then each $1 of capital supports $2.5 of exposure. So exposure = 2.5 × 40,000,000 = 100,000,000. Intuition: 2× would be 80m; add another half (0.5×40m = 20m) to get 100m."

    "answer": "16%",
    "explanation": "First principles: volatility is a measure of how widely returns fluctuate. If returns scale up and down with exposure (a linear approximation), then the dispersion of returns scales too. With 2× exposure, a given market move tends to produce about 2× the return impact. Therefore volatility approximately doubles: 2 × 8% = 16%. This is why leverage is described as increasing risk exposure: it widens the distribution of outcomes, not just the average."
