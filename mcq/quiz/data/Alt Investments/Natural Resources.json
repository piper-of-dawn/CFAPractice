First, the 'factory' concept means the asset manufactures its own inventory via photosynthesis—trees grow volume regardless of the economy. Second, the 'warehouse' concept means you are not forced to sell; if lumber prices crash, you store the value 'on the stump' where it continues to grow. Finally, the geographic concentration of investable private timberland is historically centered in the US (approx. 50%).</p><p>Statement 3 is incorrect (making A, C, and D wrong): Timberland returns are driven by biological growth and local land values, not corporate earnings. Therefore, they historically show very low or zero correlation with public equities, which is their primary value for diversification.</p>",

You cannot speed up a biological harvest or build a mine overnight. Reason (R) is True: It accurately describes the physical reality (lead times, growth cycles) that causes the inelasticity.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: The Roll Process</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Contango means the price curve slopes up ($Spot < Future$). You own the Spot month. It is about to expire. You must sell it (at Low Price X). You want to keep the position. You must buy the Next month. It costs (High Price X+Y). You just sold low and bought high. You have fewer contracts for the same money. This loss of value is the 'negative roll yield'. R describes the mechanical action that causes the loss in A.</p><p>B is incorrect because the causal link is direct. C and D are incorrect as both are true.</p>",
