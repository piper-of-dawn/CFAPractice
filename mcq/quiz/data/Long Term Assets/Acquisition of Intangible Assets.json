    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Identifiability–Control–Benefits</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> From first principles, an intangible asset can only be recognized when it represents a future economic resource the entity can both point to and control. IFRS embeds this logic through three criteria: identifiability (the asset is separable or arises from contractual/legal rights), control (the firm can restrict others’ access to the benefit), and probability of future economic benefits. If these conditions fail, the asset cannot be capitalized because it lacks the essential qualities of an economic resource. Applying this to the question, option B directly matches all three IFRS requirements.</p><p>A is incorrect because legal protection alone does not guarantee control or future benefits. A trademark can have a long legal life but still fail to meet recognition criteria if benefits are uncertain.</p><p>C is incorrect because internal development is not required for recognition; purchased intangible assets also qualify, and internally developed assets face additional research-versus-development hurdles.</p>"

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Observable Cost vs. Uncertain Creation</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Purchased intangibles have a clear, observable transaction price—making measurement straightforward—so capitalization is required. Internally developed assets do not have this external verification; early expenditures are uncertain and exploratory. IFRS therefore forces expensing during the research phase and allows capitalization only after technical feasibility and intent to complete are demonstrated in the development phase. This distinction ensures that only expenditures tied to a demonstrably valuable asset become capitalized.</p><p>B is incorrect because sale to external customers is irrelevant to recognition; capitalization depends on control and future benefits, not external sales.</p><p>C is incorrect because research costs must be expensed.

During research, outcomes are unknown, so expensing is required. Once feasibility and intent to complete are demonstrated, the expenditures contribute directly to constructing a future economic resource and can be capitalized. This reflects the core principle: capitalize only when value creation is sufficiently certain.</p><p>A is incorrect because research expenditures are inherently uncertain, exploratory, and lack evidence of future benefits.</p><p>C is incorrect because post-deployment maintenance preserves, not enhances, asset value and thus must be expensed as incurred.</p>"

Technological feasibility acts as this gate. Before feasibility, expenditures are exploratory and uncertain; after feasibility, the firm is constructing an asset with expected future utility. Thus, GAAP capitalizes costs incurred after feasibility but before the software is ready for use.</p><p>A is incorrect because capitalization does not wait until completion; it begins after feasibility and continues through development.</p><p>C is incorrect because preliminary design and feasibility studies occur before technological feasibility is established and must be expensed as incurred.</p>"

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Residual Value After Identifiable Assets</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> Goodwill is a residual—representing synergies, assembled workforce, customer relationships, and other benefits that cannot be individually identified or valued. Under the acquisition method, the acquirer first allocates the purchase price to identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value.

This ordering ensures that goodwill is not overstated and reflects only the portion of value that cannot be attributed to separable assets.</p><p>A is incorrect because equal allocation ignores economic reality and violates fair-value measurement principles.</p><p>C is incorrect because goodwill is a residual; it cannot be measured before identifiable assets.</p>"
