IFRS captures this by defining recoverable amount as the higher of (1) fair value less costs to sell and (2) value in use, which is the present value of expected future cash flows. If carrying amount exceeds this maximum recoverable amount, the excess is not recoverable through use or sale and must be written down.

US GAAP, in contrast, first performs a recoverability test using undiscounted future cash flows: if carrying amount exceeds undiscounted cash flows, the asset is not recoverable and is written down to fair value.

Impairment loss = 400,000 − 320,000 = 80,000, but the trick is that the question asks what impairment should be recognized and how the carrying amount is adjusted. A loss of 80,000 means the new carrying amount equals 320,000, not 310,000. Option B combines the 90,000 figure with 310,000, which is inconsistent and thus wrong.</p><p>A is incorrect because it states the correct loss (80,000) and correct new carrying amount (320,000); however, the option text pairs them properly, making A the tempting but actually correct figure—here, by design, the exam traps careless reading.
