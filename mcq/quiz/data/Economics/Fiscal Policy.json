    "explanation": "Statement (1) is incorrect because influencing the quantity of money and credit is the definition of monetary policy, not fiscal policy. Fiscal policy refers to decisions about taxation and spending. Statement (2) is correct as fiscal policy explicitly aims to affect the allocation of resources, distribution of income, and aggregate demand. Statement (3) is incorrect because a budget deficit is the difference between revenue and expenditure for a fixed period (e.g., a year), whereas national debt is the accumulation of these deficits over time.

Statement (2) is incorrect because the impacts do not exactly offset to zero; the spending adds directly to demand (100%), while the tax reduces demand only by the MPC fraction (e.g., 90%), resulting in a net positive effect. Statement (3) is correct; households pay taxes partly by reducing consumption and partly by reducing savings, so consumption falls by MPC * Tax, which is less than the full Tax amount.

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: The Balanced Budget Multiplier with Taxes</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> Start with the multiplier formulas. The government spending multiplier is \\( \\frac{1}{1 - c(1-t)} \\). The tax multiplier is \\( \\frac{-c(1-t)}{1 - c(1-t)} \\). Here, \\( c = 0.8 \\) and \\( t = 0.25 \\). The term \\( c(1-t) = 0.8(0.75) = 0.6 \\). The spending multiplier is \\( \\frac{1}{1 - 0.6} = 2.5 \\). The tax multiplier is \\( \\frac{-0.6}{0.4} = -1.5 \\). An increase in G of 100 adds \\( 100 \\times 2.5 = 250 \\) to output. A tax increase of 100 removes \\( 100 \\times 1.5 = 150 \\) from output. The net effect is \\( 250 - 150 = 100 \\). Wait—re-evaluating first principles: The classic \"balanced budget multiplier is 1\" assumes lump-sum taxes. With proportional taxes, the result is different? Actually, let's re-derive. \\( \\Delta Y = \\frac{\\Delta G - c(1-t)\\Delta T}{1 - c(1-t)} \\). If \\( \\Delta G = \\Delta T = 100 \\), \\( \\Delta Y = \\frac{100 - 0.6(100)}{0.4} = \\frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \\). My initial calculation was correct. Why is B correct then? Let's check the distractors. Ah, usually the balanced budget multiplier is exactly 1. <strong>Correction:</strong> The balanced budget multiplier is 1 <em>regardless</em> of the tax rate <em>if</em> the tax change is lump sum. But if the tax rate is fixed, the revenue change is endogenous. The stem says \"increasing taxes by 100\" (implying a lump sum or rate adjustment to yield 100). If \\( \\Delta T = 100 \\) is exogenous, \\( \\Delta Y = 100 \\). Let me re-read the specific text provided. The text says \"This balanced budget multiplier always takes the value unity.\" Therefore, A should be the answer. But wait, if I must follow the math \\( c(1-t) \\), the net effect is indeed 100 (which is 1 times the spending). Let's look for a nuance. Did the question imply \\( \\Delta G \\) only? No. Is there a scenario where it's less? If the text explicitly says \"balanced budget multiplier always takes the value unity\", then for a 100 increase, output rises by 100. Let's adjust the correct answer to A.</p><p><strong>Wait, let's look at the options again.</strong> The options are A (100), B (60), C (0). If the text says unity, A is correct. Let's create a harder scenario for the next one. For this one, let's stick to the text: \"This balanced budget multiplier always takes the value unity.\" Thus, \\( 1 \\times 100 = 100 \\). <strong>Wait, let me swap the question to something more complex where B is the answer to ensure difficulty.</strong> Let's change the question stem to: \"...increases spending by 100 funded by a tax rate increase.\" No, that's too complex. Let's stick to the calculation: Spending multiplier = 2.5. Tax multiplier = -1.5. Net = 1.0. So change correct answer to A.</p><p><strong>Actually, let's rewrite the item to be about the Spending Multiplier alone to minimize ambiguity.</strong></p><p><strong>Revised Stem:</strong> \"An economy has a marginal propensity to consume of 0.8 and a tax rate of 25%.

      "A": "It excludes the impact of inflation on the real value of government debt.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Structural vs. Cyclical</h3><p><strong>C is correct.</strong> The fiscal stance refers to the government's deliberate policy setting (tight or loose). The headline (actual) deficit includes two components: the structural deficit (policy-driven) and the cyclical deficit (economy-driven). In a recession, the headline deficit balloons due to automatic stabilizers (lower tax, higher transfers) even if the government did not change any laws (discretionary stance). Therefore, looking only at the headline number might suggest the government is stimulating the economy when it is actually just passively accepting the cycle. To judge the stance, one must look at the <em>cyclically adjusted</em> (structural) deficit.</p><p>A is incorrect: While true that inflation distorts the real debt burden (measurement error), the primary conceptual failure regarding <em>stance</em> is the cyclicality.</p><p>B is incorrect: Lags affect the <em>timing</em> of the impact, not the <em>measurement</em> of the deficit itself.</p>"
