The Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model expands this to two factors (capital and labor) and assumes technology is identical across countries. In H-O, comparative advantage arises because countries differ in their relative endowment of factors (e.g., one is capital-rich, one is labor-rich). A country will export the good that intensively uses its abundant factor. Thus, H-O is an endowment-driven model.</p><p>A is incorrect: This is the definition of the Ricardian model, which focuses on labor productivity (technology) as the sole driver.</p><p>C is incorrect: Economies of scale are the basis for New Trade Theory (Intra-industry trade), not the traditional H-O model which assumes constant returns to scale.</p>"

With a quota, this price difference becomes \"quota rent\" (excess profit per unit). If the government auctions the quota rights, it captures the rent (equivalent to tariff).

The \"markup\" (quota rent) is thus collected by the foreign exporter, not the domestic government.
