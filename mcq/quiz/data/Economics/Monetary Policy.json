    "stem": "Consider the following statements regarding the roles of central banks in a modern economy:\n(1) In a fiat money system, the central bank's ability to supply currency is constrained by the amount of gold reserves it holds.\n(2) The central bank acts as a lender of last resort to prevent bank runs by providing liquidity when the interbank market freezes.\n(3) Central banks in all G10 countries are the sole supervisory authority for their respective banking systems.\nWhich of the statements given above are correct?",

      "C": "2 and 3 only"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Statement (1) is incorrect because fiat money is not convertible into gold; its supply is not constrained by gold reserves but by government decree and policy decisions. Statement (2) is correct as the lender of last resort function is designed to supply funds to solvent but illiquid banks during crises to prevent contagion. Statement (3) is incorrect because banking supervision is not exclusively a central bank role in all G10 countries; for example, in Germany and the US, it is shared with other agencies (like the FDIC or OCC). Therefore, only statement (2) is correct. Option B is incorrect due to statement (1). Option C is incorrect due to statement (3)."

    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct; buying bonds (repo) injects liquidity into the banking system, increasing reserves. Statement (2) is incorrect; increasing the reserve requirement *reduces* the funds available for lending, thereby *decreasing* the money multiplier.

Statement (2) is correct; higher discount rates lower the present value of assets (bonds, equities), reducing wealth and consumption (wealth effect). Statement (3) is correct; long-term rates reflect expected future short-term rates and inflation premiums, so expectations play a crucial role. Therefore, statements (2) and (3) are correct.

    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct; pegging to a stable currency anchors domestic price expectations. Statement (2) is incorrect; under a fixed exchange rate, domestic monetary policy loses independence—interest rates must track the anchor country's rates to maintain the peg. Statement (3) is correct; higher domestic inflation depreciates the currency, forcing the central bank to intervene (sell reserves, buy local currency) and tighten money supply to restore value.

Statement (3) is incorrect because banking supervision is not exclusively a central bank role in all G10 countries; for example, in Germany and the US, it is shared with other agencies (like the FDIC or OCC).

Statement (2) is incorrect; under a fixed exchange rate, domestic monetary policy loses independence—interest rates must track the anchor country's rates to maintain the peg.
