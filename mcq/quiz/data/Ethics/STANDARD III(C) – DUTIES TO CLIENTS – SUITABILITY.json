The governing principle is that 'one size fits all' advice is inherently unsuitable when client profiles differ. The mechanism of violation: Smith recommended a high-risk, zero-income asset class to Lanai, whose objective is low volatility and steady returns (income/safety). While the investment might fit Robertson (high risk tolerance), applying the same advice to Lanai ignores her specific constraints.

The misconception is that 'some exposure to everything' is always good—asset classes must first pass the suitability filter for the client's specific risk tolerance.</p><p>C is incorrect: Suitability is not just about time horizon; it includes liquidity needs and risk tolerance.

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Portfolio Context vs. Instrument Risk</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> From first principles, risk is measured at the portfolio level, not the instrument level. The governing relationship: a 'risky' instrument (like an option) can <em>reduce</em> total portfolio risk when used for hedging or income generation (covered calls). The mechanism: covered calls exchange upside potential for immediate income (premium), which buffers the portfolio against small price drops. For a risk-averse client needing income, this structure specifically addresses their needs. The boundary condition: McDowell explained the risks and mechanics, ensuring the client understands the trade-off. By focusing on the <em>net effect</em> on the portfolio (income + protection), McDowell correctly applied the suitability standard.</p><p>A is incorrect: Instruments are tools; their suitability depends on <em>how</em> they are used. The misconception is labeling specific assets as 'bad' without considering their role in the portfolio architecture.</p><p>C is incorrect: The duty is to match the client's mandate, not 'maximize returns' at all costs.

The governing principle: when the inputs (circumstances) change materially, the output (strategy) must be re-evaluated. The mechanism: a 4x increase in wealth fundamentally alters risk capacity, tax constraints, and liquidity needs. The old IPS is now obsolete. The boundary condition: material changes trigger an immediate review requirement; acting on old instructions (or waiting a year) exposes the client to a strategy that no longer fits their reality.</p><p>A is incorrect: The existing weights were built for a different financial reality (poor Jones).

Investors buy the fund specifically to receive the promised characteristic (high income). The governing rule: the manager must stick to the stated style/strategy. The mechanism of violation: buying a zero-dividend stock fundamentally contradicts the 'income' objective.

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Hard Constraints in IPS</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Start with the nature of institutional constraints: insurance companies have liabilities that require specific liquidity profiles. The IPS constraints (liquid, max 5 years) are risk controls derived from these liability needs. The mechanism of violation: Gubler bought an illiquid asset (VC fund with lockup) that explicitly fails the 'liquid investments' test. The boundary condition: 'Attractive returns' do not justify violating risk constraints. Suitability is a binary filter—if it doesn't fit the constraints, the return potential is irrelevant.</p><p>B is incorrect: A constraint is a rule, not a guideline. The misconception is that small violations are acceptable—if the IPS prohibits illiquid assets, 4% is 4% too much.</p><p>C is incorrect: The CIO executes the mandate; they do not rewrite it on the fly.

The mechanism of violation: Snead increased risk (high beta) to gamble for a short-term payout (bonus).
