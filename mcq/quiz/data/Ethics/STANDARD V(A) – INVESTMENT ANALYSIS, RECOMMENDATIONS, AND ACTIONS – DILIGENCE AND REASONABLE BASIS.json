    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: The Foundation of Advice</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> Start with the definition of 'Reasonable Basis': it requires investigation supported by appropriate research <em>before</em> acting. The governing principle: Professional judgment cannot be bypassed for speed. The mechanism of violation: Hawke substituted a heuristic (size = price) for actual analysis (fundamentals, risk, etc.). By explicitly deciding to 'justify later', she admitted the decision had no basis <em>at the time it was made</em>. The boundary condition: External pressure (deadlines) never excuses the lack of diligence. If you can't do the work, you can't give the advice.</p><p>A is incorrect: Time pressure is a business constraint, not an ethical exemption. The flaw is prioritizing the deal schedule over the integrity of the valuation.</p><p>C is incorrect: Relative valuation requires comparable metrics (margins, growth), not just 'size'. The misconception is that using a valid <em>method</em> (relative value) poorly counts as diligence.</p>"

The governing relationship: The validity of a recommendation relies on the current reality of the investment. The mechanism of violation: The departure of the team destroys the 'reasonable basis' for the recommendation (the skill is gone).

The boundary condition: Diligence doesn't stop when the spreadsheet is closed; it stops when the client acts.

The governing principle: A 'reasonable basis' can exist for multiple conflicting viewpoints. The mechanism: If the committee's view is grounded in fact and logic (reasonable), Mastakis can associate with it as a 'firm' product, even if her personal view differs. The boundary condition: She would only need to dissociate if the committee's view had <em>no</em> reasonable basis (e.g., was forced by banking pressure) or was factually false.

Thompson applied first-principles reasoning (prices <em>can</em> fall) to stress-test the asset. The boundary condition: Ignoring a plausible economic risk just because it hasn't happened yet (the 'turkey problem') is a failure of diligence.
