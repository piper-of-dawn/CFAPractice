The governing principle is 'Full and Fair Disclosure'. The mechanism of violation: Retaining fees from portfolio companies is a form of compensation that reduces the net value or potential return to the fund investor (or creates a conflict). Hiding this 'retainer' prevents the client from assessing the true fee load and the manager's incentives. The boundary condition: 'Industry practice' or 'client sophistication' are never valid excuses for non-disclosure of compensation. If the client pays it (directly or indirectly via portfolio companies), they must know about it.</p><p>A is incorrect: Benefit to the client does not absolve the duty of disclosure. The flaw is assuming that 'good outcomes' justify 'hidden processes'.</p><p>C is incorrect: Sophistication is not a license to withhold material facts. The misconception is that experts don't need the fine print—standard V(B) applies to all client types.</p>"

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Materiality of Process Changes</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> From first principles, clients hire managers for a specific <em>process</em>, not just an outcome. The governing relationship is the 'expectation of consistency'. The mechanism: Moving from a 'hard data' model (P/E) to a 'forecast-based' model (DDM with projections) fundamentally changes the source of risk (from valuation risk to estimation risk). This is a material change in <em>how</em> the sausage is made. The boundary condition: Any change that alters the risk characteristics or decision engine of the strategy must be disclosed. Clients bought a P/E strategy; they are now in a DDM strategy—they have a right to know and decide if they want to stay.</p><p>B is incorrect: Style labels (Value) are too broad. The misconception is that as long as the label fits, the machinery doesn't matter. Standard V(B) requires disclosure of the <em>process</em>, not just the style.</p><p>C is incorrect: Proprietary tools are not exempt if they constitute the core investment process.

The governing rule: Analysts must distinguish between facts and opinions. The mechanism of violation: A reserve calculation, no matter how rigorous, is an <em>estimate</em> based on geological probability. Labeling it a 'fact' implies 100% certainty, which misleads the client about the risk of the asset (the gold might not be there).

Even if distant, this structural feature defines the investment's lifespan and scalability. Omitting it paints a false picture of an infinite-growth opportunity.

The mechanism of violation: Changing <em>how</em> the price is calculated (methodology) without telling the payer is a breach of transparency. Even if the price goes down <em>now</em>, the new method might cost more <em>later</em> (e.g., if month-end values spike). The boundary condition: All changes to cost structures are material.

The mechanism of violation: Thomas sold the 'sizzle' (high returns) but hid the 'steak' (the mechanism and risk profile).

The boundary condition: You can hide the <em>code</em> (IP), but you cannot hide the <em>payoff function</em> (what happens if I'm wrong?).

The governing rule: If the block changes shape (becomes mid-cap), the builder (client) must know. The mechanism of violation: By changing the definition of 'small cap' to include much larger companies ($8B), the firm has engaged in style drift.
