The governing principle is 'Full and Fair Disclosure'. The mechanism of violation: Retaining fees from portfolio companies is a form of compensation that reduces the net value or potential return to the fund investor (or creates a conflict). Hiding this 'retainer' prevents the client from assessing the true fee load and the manager's incentives. The boundary condition: 'Industry practice' or 'client sophistication' are never valid excuses for non-disclosure of compensation. If the client pays it (directly or indirectly via portfolio companies), they must know about it.</p><p>A is incorrect: Benefit to the client does not absolve the duty of disclosure. The flaw is assuming that 'good outcomes' justify 'hidden processes'.</p><p>C is incorrect: Sophistication is not a license to withhold material facts.
