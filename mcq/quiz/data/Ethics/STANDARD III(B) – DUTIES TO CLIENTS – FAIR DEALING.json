The governing principle is that 'fair' does not mean 'equal' (simultaneous delivery isn't always possible), but it strictly prohibits prioritizing one group over another. The mechanism of the violation here is selective disclosure: providing actionable information (the buy rating) to a subset of clients (luncheon attendees) before the general client base allows the privileged group to front-run the others. The boundary condition is that even if the report is 'finished' and just waiting for review, the information cannot be shared until it is released to all eligible clients. By tipping off the lunch guests a week early, Ames destroyed the fairness of the opportunity.</p><p>A is incorrect: the status of the report (decided vs. undecided) is irrelevant; the timing of the dissemination is what matters. The misconception is that a 'finished' idea is public property—it remains confidential until fair distribution occurs.</p><p>C is incorrect: the mode of communication (verbal vs. written) does not alter the material nature of the investment advice.
