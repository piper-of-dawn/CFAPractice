The derivation relies entirely on the ratio of the spread in option payoffs to the spread in asset prices to ensure the portfolio value is invariant to the market move.</p><p>A is incorrect: The hedge ratio depends on the structure of the payoffs ($c_u, c_dUSD ) and the asset prices (S_u, S_d$), not solely the risk-free rate.
