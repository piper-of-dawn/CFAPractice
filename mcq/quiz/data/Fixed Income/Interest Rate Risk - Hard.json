    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Coupon Level and Cash‑Flow Weights</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Reading 56’s duration properties state that, holding maturity and yield constant, lower coupon bonds have higher duration.[file:1] A discount bond must have a coupon rate below its YTM, while a premium bond’s coupon exceeds its YTM.[file:1] Lower coupons mean smaller interim cash flows and a larger share of present value concentrated in the final principal payment.[file:1] This shifts the PV‑weighted average time to receipt toward maturity, raising Macaulay duration for the discount bond relative to the premium bond.</p><p>B is incorrect because a higher price does not by itself imply greater interest rate risk; duration depends on timing and weighting of cash flows, not just level of price.[file:1] Premium bonds actually have lower duration because their larger early coupons pull the average cash‑flow time earlier.</p><p>C is incorrect because having the same maturity and YTM does not guarantee the same duration; coupon rate is a key determinant.[file:1] The reading explicitly shows different Macaulay durations for premium, par, and discount bonds with the same yield and maturity.</p>"

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Saw‑Tooth Pattern of Duration</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> The duration reading referenced in Reading 56 plots Macaulay duration for a fixed‑rate bond with constant yield and shows a saw‑tooth pattern.[file:1] Between coupon payments, as time elapses (t/T rises), all cash‑flow dates move closer, so time‑to‑receipt terms shrink and the PV‑weighted average time to cash flows falls.[file:1] Thus Macaulay duration decreases smoothly on each day of the coupon period until the coupon date.[file:1]</p><p>B is incorrect because an increase in duration would require cash flows to move further away in time or weights to shift toward later cash flows, neither of which happens between coupon dates when yield is constant.[file:1]</p><p>C is incorrect because the reading explicitly emphasizes that duration is not static; it changes over time even if yields stay constant.[file:1] Only at coupon payment dates does duration jump upward slightly, because a cash flow has just been paid and the remaining pattern of cash flows changes discretely.</p>"

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Convexity and Large Yield Increases</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> For option‑free bonds, the price‑yield curve is convex.[file:1] Duration gives the slope (tangent) at the initial yield and assumes a straight‑line relationship.[file:1] For a large yield increase, the actual price path curves above the tangent line (price falls less than linearly), because the second‑order convexity term is positive.[file:1] Therefore, duration alone will predict a larger percentage loss than actually occurs; adding the convexity adjustment reduces the estimated loss. The effect is especially strong for long‑maturity, low‑coupon bonds, which have high convexity.[file:1]</p><p>A is incorrect because underestimation of losses would require negative convexity, where the curve bends the other way and prices fall more than duration predicts for rate rises.[file:1] This happens with some callable or prepayable bonds, not with standard long‑dated option‑free bonds highlighted in the reading.</p><p>C is incorrect because the curriculum stresses that duration alone is adequate only for small yield changes.[file:1] A 300 bp move is large, and the convexity adjustment becomes material, particularly for long‑duration, high‑convexity issues.</p>"

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Interest Rate Risk Profile</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Reading 56 and the duration properties show that longer maturity and lower coupon both increase duration and convexity.[file:1] The 15‑year 3% bond therefore has much higher duration and convexity than the 2‑year 7% bond.[file:1] In a rising‑rate environment, large duration means larger price declines; convexity only partially offsets this for large moves but does not reverse it.[file:1] A defensive strategy under rising rates seeks low duration and low PVBP, which the 2‑year high‑coupon bond provides.</p><p>B is incorrect because while higher convexity is beneficial in both rising and falling rate environments, it does not prevent a long‑duration bond from suffering a larger absolute price drop when yields increase substantially.[file:1] The first‑order duration effect still dominates.</p><p>C is incorrect because lower coupon reduces reinvestment risk but increases price risk via higher duration; under a strong rising‑rate view, the primary concern is near‑term mark‑to‑market loss from higher yields, not reinvestment shortfall.[file:1]</p>"
