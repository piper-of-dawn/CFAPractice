The curve bends backward.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong><br>1. <strong>The Option Effect (Statement 1 & 2):</strong> A callable bond = Straight Bond − Call Option.

This creates a price ceiling (compression).<br>2. <strong>Unfavorable Duration (Statement 4):</strong> Normally, when yields fall, duration increases (good for price gains). With negative convexity, as yields fall, the bond acts more like a short-term cash instrument (because it's about to be called). The duration <em>shrinks</em> right when you want it to grow. This is 'unfavorable' behavior.<br>3. <strong>Not Always Negative (Statement 3):</strong> If yields are very high (e.g., 15%), the issuer has zero incentive to call a 5% bond.

Convexity is the math that fixes this widening gap.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong><br>1. <strong>The Quadratic Term (Statement 1):</strong> The Taylor Series approximation for price change is: \(\Delta P \approx -Dur \times \Delta y + \frac{1}{2}Conv \times (\Delta y)^2\). Notice the \((\Delta y)^2\). This proves convexity scales with the square of the yield change.<br>2. <strong>Duration Error (Statement 2):</strong> Since the curve bends away from the tangent line, the error of using only the tangent line grows as you move further out. This error is systematic and significant for large moves.<br>3. <strong>Relevance (Statement 3 & 4):</strong> For tiny yield changes (e.g., 1 basis point), \((\Delta y)^2\) is effectively zero.

If \(f''\) and \(g''\) are positive, the sum is positive.<br>3. <strong>Result (Assertion A):</strong> Since a bond is simply the sum of these cash flows, the total bond price <em>must</em> inherit this convex property.

A is false.<br>2. <strong>Structural Divergence (Reason R):</strong> If Assets and Liabilities have the same duration but different convexities, a large yield move will cause their values to change by different amounts.

Thus, A is false.<br>2. <strong>The Reality (Reason R):</strong> A bond has cash flows at year 1, year 5, year 10, etc. Each of these is discounted by a <em>different</em> rate on the spot curve.

This is the opposite of how normal bonds behave.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong><br>1. <strong>Mechanism (Reason R):</strong> For callable bonds or MBS, rising yields reduce the incentive to prepay/call.
