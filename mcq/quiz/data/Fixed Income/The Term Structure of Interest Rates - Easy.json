    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Defining Spot Rates</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Starting from the definition of discount rates, a spot rate is the market discount rate for default-risk-free zero-coupon bonds, also called zero rates or strip rates. These rates represent the pure time value of money for a given maturity with no coupon reinvestment risk. The spot curve is built from yields on zero-coupon bonds or derived from recently issued government bonds. By definition, since zero-coupon bonds have no interim cash flows, their yield-to-maturity equals the spot rate for that maturity. The formula is \\( PV = FV/(1+Z_N)^N \\), where \\( Z_N \\) is the spot rate. This fundamental relationship makes spot rates the building blocks for all term structure analysis and ensures no-arbitrage pricing.</p><p>B is incorrect because current yield is simply the annual coupon payment divided by the bond's current price (\\( CY = Annual\\,Coupon/Price \\)), ignoring time value of money and maturity considerations. This is not a spot rate, which specifically applies to zero-coupon bonds and represents the discount rate for a single future cash flow at a specific maturity.</p><p>C is incorrect because forward rates are rates for periods beginning in the future, not today. While a spot rate does start today, it represents immediate investment, whereas forward rates represent future reinvestment rates. The 1-year spot rate could be called the 0y1y forward rate, but this terminology conflates two distinct concepts.</p>"

Therefore, an upward-sloping spot curve means \\( Z_2 > Z_1 \\), \\( Z_3 > Z_2 \\), etc. This is the normal or typical yield curve shape under standard economic conditions, reflecting expectations of higher rates in the future, inflation risk premiums, or liquidity premiums for bearing longer-maturity risk.

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Par-Spot Relationship</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> In an upward-sloping curve, earlier spot rates are lower than later ones (\\( Z_1 < Z_2 < Z_3 \\)). The par rate is calculated such that \\( 100 = \\sum c/(1+Z_i)^i + 100/(1+Z_N)^N \\). Since early coupons are discounted at lower rates than the final spot rate \\( Z_N \\), they contribute more present value per unit of coupon. Therefore, the par coupon c can be less than \\( Z_N \\) and still achieve par pricing. For example, with \\( Z_1=2\\%, Z_2=4\\% \\), the 2-year par rate is approximately 3.96%, below the 4% spot rate. This relationship is fundamental: in upward-sloping curves, Par < Spot < Forward at each maturity, reflecting the averaging effect of par rates versus marginal (forward) and terminal (spot) rates.</p><p>B is incorrect because par rates equal spot rates only when the curve is flat. In that special case, all discounting occurs at the same rate, so the par coupon exactly equals the constant spot rate. With an upward slope, the differential discounting of early versus late cash flows breaks this equality, making the par rate a weighted average below the terminal spot rate.</p><p>C is incorrect because par rates above spot rates characterize downward-sloping (inverted) curves where \\( Z_1 > Z_N \\). Early coupons discounted at high rates contribute less PV, requiring higher par coupons to reach par pricing. The upward-sloping premise guarantees the reverse: par rates fall below spot rates as early low-rate discounting boosts coupon PV contributions.</p>"

The bond trades at a premium because the 6% coupon exceeds both relevant spot rates (4% and 5%). From first principles, when cash flows exceed what the market requires (spot rates), investors pay a premium to obtain those superior flows. The premium of 1.92 represents the excess present value of receiving 6% coupons when the market only requires 4-5% returns. This no-arbitrage pricing ensures investors cannot construct a cheaper synthetic equivalent using zero-coupon bonds, maintaining market efficiency.</p><p>A is incorrect because par pricing (PV = 100) occurs when the coupon rate equals the yield-to-maturity, which would require the weighted average discount rate to equal 6%. Since both spot rates (4%, 5%) are substantially below 6%, the bond must trade above par. The par rate for this spot curve would be approximately 4.98%, well below the 6% coupon, confirming premium pricing.</p><p>C is incorrect because discount pricing (PV < 100) requires the coupon to fall below the discount rates. Here, the 6% coupon exceeds both the 4% and 5% spot rates, creating excess cash flows that command a premium.

Zero-coupon bonds eliminate coupon reinvestment risk and provide pure single-period rates. The formula \\( Z_N = (FV/PV)^{1/N} - 1 \\) directly extracts the spot rate from each bond's price without requiring bootstrapping or matrix pricing. These bonds satisfy the \"other things equal\" requirement: same currency, credit risk, liquidity, and tax status, differing only in maturity. This ensures the spot curve isolates the pure term structure effect without confounding factors. In practice, government zero-coupon bonds (strips) serve this purpose, though their limited availability often necessitates deriving spot curves from coupon bonds using bootstrapping.</p><p>B is incorrect because high-coupon premium bonds introduce coupon reinvestment risk and tax complexities that obscure pure spot rates. Premium pricing also indicates the bonds were issued when rates were lower, making them less liquid and potentially creating tax differentials between capital losses and interest income in some jurisdictions.

Any deviation would be immediately exploited in efficient markets, driving prices back to the no-arbitrage relationship.

This assumes the term structure is flat and that reinvestment opportunities are constant. Spot rate pricing recognizes that rates vary by maturity (\\( PV = \\sum PMT/(1+Z_i)^i \\)), using the appropriate rate for each cash flow's timing. This eliminates the unrealistic constant-reinvestment assumption embedded in YTM. For example, in an upward-sloping curve, early cash flows should be discounted at lower rates and later flows at higher rates, which spot rates capture but YTM does not. Spot rate pricing thus provides more accurate, no-arbitrage valuations that reflect actual market term structure, especially important when the curve is not flat. YTM remains useful as a summary statistic but is inferior for precise valuation.</p><p>B is incorrect because spot rates do not systematically result in higher prices than YTM. The price relationship depends on curve shape: in upward-sloping curves, spot rate pricing often yields lower prices for premium bonds and higher prices for discount bonds compared to using a single YTM. The advantage is accuracy and no-arbitrage consistency, not directional price bias. Both methods can produce identical prices if YTM happens to equal the par rate.</p><p>C is incorrect because spot rate pricing requires more calculation, not less. You must apply different discount rates (\\( Z_1, Z_2, ... Z_N \\)) to each cash flow rather than a single YTM (r). The computational burden increases with the number of cash flows. However, this additional complexity is worthwhile because it produces arbitrage-free prices reflecting actual market conditions rather than the simplification of assuming a flat term structure implicit in single-YTM pricing.</p>"

Therefore, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times (+) \\times (+) = (+) \\) regardless of whether yields rise or fall.

Longer maturity pushes cash flows further into the future, increasing the weighted average time and thus duration. From the duration formula \\( MacDur = \\sum (t \\times w_t) \\), extending maturity adds distant cash flows with large t values, pulling the average upward. For example, extending maturity from 5 to 10 years adds 5 years of coupon payments and delays principal by 5 years, substantially increasing duration. This relationship is monotonic but nonlinear—duration increases with maturity but at a decreasing rate, approaching a limit for perpetual bonds. Longer maturity means greater price sensitivity to yield changes because distant cash flows have larger present value volatility.</p><p>A is incorrect because higher coupon rates decrease duration, not increase it. Higher coupons shift cash flow weighting toward earlier periods (larger near-term coupons) and away from principal (which is relatively smaller), reducing the weighted-average time. For example, a zero-coupon bond has duration equal to maturity, while a high-coupon bond has duration well below maturity. Higher coupons provide more \"ballast\" in early periods, reducing sensitivity to yield changes.</p><p>B is incorrect because higher yields decrease duration, not increase it. Higher discount rates reduce the present value of distant cash flows more than near-term cash flows (exponential discounting), shifting weight toward earlier periods and lowering the weighted average.

If rates rise, the loss from selling the bond below its original trajectory is roughly offset by gains from reinvesting coupons at higher rates. If rates fall, the gain from selling at a premium offsets the loss from reinvesting at lower rates. This is the fundamental insight of immunization: matching duration to horizon creates a hedge against interest rate risk. The offsetting occurs because duration represents the holding period where these two countervailing forces balance. This principle is used in liability-driven investing and pension fund management to lock in returns regardless of rate changes.</p><p>B is incorrect because credit risk (default risk) is unrelated to duration matching.
