    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct. The flat price (or clean price) is the quoted price. It excludes accrued interest so that the price does not appear to drop significantly solely because a coupon payment was made. Statement (2) is incorrect because the full price (invoice or dirty price) is the flat price *plus* accrued interest, not minus. The buyer pays the full price. Statement (3) is correct. Accrued interest is determined by the coupon rate and the day count convention (time passed); it does not depend on the market discount rate (yield-to-maturity). Calculation logic: On a calculator like the TI BA2 Plus, bond functions (2nd BOND) separate these values. One inputs the settlement date (SDT) and coupon rate (CPN), and the calculator computes AI (Accrued Interest) and PRI (Flat Price) separately from the yield inputs. Therefore, Option B is the correct set."

Statement (3) is correct. This is the fundamental inverse relationship: as the discount rate (I/Y on a TI BA2 Plus) increases, the Present Value (PV) decreases because future cash flows are discounted more heavily.

If the market discount rate (YTM) is unchanged, a discount bond's price will rise over time to reach par at maturity. \nReason (R) is false. The mechanism is not just about the principal 'dominating.' It is about the coupon deficiency. A discount bond pays a coupon lower than the market rate (e.g., pays 3% when market wants 5%). The price is discounted to compensate for this lower payment. As maturity nears, the number of periods where the investor receives this 'deficient' coupon decreases. The penalty applied to the price therefore shrinks, causing the price to rise toward par. It is not independent of the coupon rate; the relationship between coupon and yield drives the discount.\n\nCalculator Illustration (Pull-to-Par):\nConsider a 4-year, 3% coupon bond, YTM 5%.\n[2nd] [CLR TVM]\n4 [N], 5 [I/Y], 3 [PMT], 100 [FV] -> [CPT] [PV] = -92.90 (Price = 92.90)\nNow, move to 1 year later (3 years remaining), same YTM.\n3 [N] -> [CPT] [PV] = -94.55 (Price rose to 94.55)\nThis confirms the price increases as N decreases."

The full price represents the actual cash changing hands. Because it includes the accrued interest that builds up daily, it constantly rises between coupons and drops sharply when the coupon is paid. \nReason (R) is true and explains A.

Holding to maturity is condition #1. However, condition #2 is reinvestment. The investor will only realize the YTM if they can reinvest every coupon at the original YTM rate. If interest rates fall, they reinvest at lower rates, and realized return < YTM (reinvestment risk).\nReason (R) is true in that it identifies a reinvestment assumption, but it states the assumption incorrectly. YTM assumes reinvestment at the *YTM* (market discount rate), NOT the coupon rate. Wait—actually, R says 'reinvested at the coupon rate'. This is a specific trap. The standard YTM assumption is reinvestment at the YTM. Thus, R is actually False as written in standard finance theory. However, looking closer at the prompt options: If A is False, we check R. R is technically a false statement about the definition of YTM. But often students confuse this. Let's re-read the standard definition. YTM assumes reinvestment at the computed yield, r. Therefore, Reason (R) is False. \nCorrection: Option D (A is False, R is True) would imply R is a correct statement. R is NOT a correct statement. Let's re-evaluate the question design for 'D' or 'C'. \nIf I want 'A is False', R must be True? No, I can have both false. But the options don't allow 'Both False'. \nLet's adjust the Reason to be a TRUE statement that doesn't explain A, or make R true. \nLet's stick to the current text and analyze strictly: R says 'reinvested at the coupon rate'. This is false. \nI will Modify the Reason in the JSON to make it a TRUE statement for Option D, or adjust the Assertion. \n\nLet's change the stem for clarity to fit the requested Difficulty/Option D profile:\nNew Assertion: An investor who holds an option-free bond to maturity is guaranteed to earn the Yield-to-Maturity calculated at purchase. (False - reinvestment risk).\nNew Reason: The YTM calculation assumes that all interim cash flows are reinvested at the computed yield-to-maturity rate. (True).\nNow this fits Option D perfectly.\n\nCalculator Illustration (Reinvestment Risk):\nBuy 10% coupon bond at par (YTM 10%). 2 years. Price 100.\nCoupons: $10 at year 1, $10 at year 2 + $100 principal.\nFV of coupons if reinvested at 10%: $10 * 1.10 + $10 = $21. Total = $121.\nReturn = (121/100)^(1/2) - 1 = 10%.\nIf rates drop to 5%: Year 1 coupon earns 5%. $10 * 1.05 + $10 = $20.5. Total $120.5.\nReturn = (120.5/100)^(1/2) - 1 = 9.77% (Less than YTM)."

This is the definition of the Maturity Effect. \nRelationship: While R is true, it is not the *complete* explanation for A. A compares a *zero-coupon* long bond to a *high-coupon* short bond. The extreme volatility of A is due to *both* the Maturity Effect AND the Coupon Effect (zeros are more volatile). R only mentions maturity. Is it the *correct* explanation? It explains part of it, but in A-R logic, if the Reason is a general principle that supports the Assertion, it's usually A. However, here, the 'Maturity Effect' usually carries the caveat 'all else equal'. A compares bonds where coupon is NOT equal. So R is technically a true statement in isolation (ceteris paribus implied in definition), but it is a weak explanation for the specific comparison in A which confounds variables. Actually, the Assertion (A) relies on duration. \nLet's re-evaluate: Is A *always* true? Yes, 30y Zero vs 10y Coupon. Duration 30 vs ~7. \nDoes R explain it?

'Exceptions to the maturity effect exist but are rare... occur for low-coupon long-term bonds trading at a discount.' But A specifies a Zero. Zeros have no exception. \nSo A is True. R is True. R explains A? Yes, maturity is the dominant driver here. \nLet's stick with B to be tricky? No, standard logic suggests A. \nActually, let's look at Option B logic: 'R is not the correct explanation'. Why? Because A involves coupon differences too.
