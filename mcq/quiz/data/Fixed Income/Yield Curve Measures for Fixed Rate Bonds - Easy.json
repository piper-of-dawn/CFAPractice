    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Equivalent Periodic Rates</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> A 4% yield on semiannual basis means 2% per 6-month period. To convert to quarterly basis, first find the effective quarterly rate equivalent to 2% semiannually: (1 + quarterly rate)² = 1.02, so quarterly rate = 1.02^(1/2) - 1 = 0.00995 or 0.995%. The quarterly-basis quotation multiplies by 4: 4 × 0.995% = 3.98%. This maintains the same effective annual yield (1.02² = 1.0404 from semiannual; 1.00995⁴ ≈ 1.0404 from quarterly) while adjusting the stated rate for different periodicity. Higher periodicity requires lower stated rates to achieve equivalent effective yields.</p><p>A is incorrect: 2% is the semiannual periodic rate, not the quarterly-basis quotation. This error fails to convert the periodicity, simply stating the semiannual rate rather than its quarterly equivalent.</p><p>C is incorrect: 4.04% is the effective annual yield, not the quarterly-basis stated yield. This uses the annual compounding result rather than converting to a quarterly quotation convention (4 times the quarterly periodic rate).</p>"

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Payment Timing Effects</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Street convention calculates yield using stated coupon payment dates from the indenture. True yield uses actual payment dates, accounting for holidays and weekends when payments are deferred to the next business day. When payments are delayed, present value increases (cash flows come later), so the bond is worth slightly more than street convention suggests. To maintain price equality, true yield must be slightly lower—if PV is higher, the discount rate must decrease. The difference is typically only a few basis points. Street convention is standard for quotation; true yield provides technical precision.</p><p>B is incorrect: True yield is lower, not higher, and the difference stems from payment timing, not compounding accuracy. Both methods use proper compounding; they differ only in which dates they use for cash flows.</p><p>C is incorrect: True yield and street convention yield differ whenever coupon dates fall on non-business days, which occurs regularly. They're identical only if all coupon dates happen to fall on business days.</p>"

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Multiple Call Scenarios</h3><p><strong>C is correct.</strong> Yield to second call uses the second call date (4 years, or 8 semiannual periods) and second call price (101). Given: N=8, PMT=3 (6%/2 of par 100), FV=101, PV=-102. Calculator: CPT I/Y = 2.830% semiannual. Quoted yield to second call = 2 × 2.830% = 5.66%. The investor pays 102, receives eight coupons of 3, and gets back 101 at call. The capital loss is smaller than with the first call (same starting price, same call price, but longer time to amortize the loss), making this yield slightly higher than yield to first call but still below the coupon rate due to the premium paid.</p><p>A is incorrect: 2.83% is the semiannual periodic rate, not the annualized yield to second call. This forgets the market convention of doubling the periodic rate to get the bond basis quotation.</p><p>B is incorrect: 5.54% is the yield to maturity (assuming the bond is held for all 5 years to par 100), not yield to second call. This uses the wrong terminal date and redemption value.</p>"

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Spread Type Taxonomy</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> A G-spread (government spread) measures the difference between a bond's YTM and a government benchmark yield of equivalent maturity. The problem specifies the spread is over a U.S. Treasury yield, which is the classic government benchmark. Whether using an actual Treasury or interpolating between available maturities does not change the classification—it is still a G-spread because the reference is a government security. The letter G denotes the government benchmark nature. This is the most common spread measure in markets using liquid government bond benchmarks.</p><p>B is incorrect: I-spread (interpolated spread) refers to spreads over swap rates, not government yields. I-spreads are common in euro-denominated markets where swap rates serve as benchmarks, but the problem uses Treasury yields, not swap rates.</p><p>C is incorrect: Z-spread (zero-volatility spread) is calculated differently—it is the constant spread added to each spot rate on the benchmark curve such that the bond's discounted cash flows equal its price. The problem describes a simple YTM differential, not a Z-spread calculation involving the entire spot curve.</p>"
