    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Zero-Coupon Bond Duration</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Starting from the definition of Macaulay duration as the weighted average time to receipt of cash flows, a zero-coupon bond has only one cash flow at maturity. Since all weight (100%) is concentrated at the maturity date, the weighted average time equals the time-to-maturity. Mathematically, \\( MacDur = \\sum (t \\times w_t) \\), where \\( w_t \\) is the weight of each cash flow. For a zero-coupon bond, \\( w_{maturity} = 1.0 \\) and all other weights are zero, so \\( MacDur = maturity \\times 1.0 = maturity \\). This fundamental property makes zero-coupon bonds unique: their duration always equals their maturity unless measured between coupon dates. This relationship serves as a benchmark for understanding that coupon-paying bonds always have duration less than maturity due to interim cash flows.</p><p>B is incorrect because half the time-to-maturity would apply only if cash flows were evenly split between mid-life and maturity, which is not the case for zero-coupon bonds. This might reflect confusion with the average life concept for amortizing securities or a misapplication of the midpoint formula, neither of which applies to duration calculations.</p><p>C is incorrect because zero duration would imply immediate receipt of all cash flows (cash has zero duration). A zero-coupon bond delivers its single payment at maturity, not immediately, so its duration must be positive and equal to the time remaining until that payment. Zero duration would only apply to cash or instruments with no time value component.</p>"

This can be verified mentally: dividing 5 by 1.04 is slightly less than 5/1.0 = 5, and since 4% of 5 is 0.20, the result should be approximately 5 - 0.19 = 4.81. Modified duration converts Macaulay duration into a direct measure of price sensitivity: a 1% yield change causes approximately a 4.81% price change. The adjustment factor \\( 1/(1+r) \\) accounts for the present value discounting mechanism and ensures modified duration properly estimates first-order price changes.</p><p>B is incorrect because 5.00 is the Macaulay duration, not the modified duration.

When the horizon exceeds duration (Duration Gap < 0), the investor will hold the bond beyond the duration point where reinvestment and price risks offset. With a long horizon, many coupon payments must be reinvested over extended periods, making their future value highly sensitive to reinvestment rates. Price risk at sale diminishes because the sale occurs far in the future (or at maturity), while compound interest on reinvested coupons dominates total return. For example, a 30-year buy-and-hold investor in a 10-year duration bond faces 20+ years of reinvestment, making falling rates the primary threat. This relationship is fundamental: long horizons shift risk from price to reinvestment.</p><p>B is incorrect because price risk dominates when the investment horizon is shorter than Macaulay duration (Duration Gap > 0), not longer. Short-horizon investors sell bonds before maturity, exposing them to market price fluctuations from yield changes. They have less time to reinvest coupons, so reinvestment risk is minimal. The question specifies a longer horizon, reversing this relationship.</p><p>C is incorrect because interest rate risk always exists through either reinvestment or price channels (or both).

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Duration Matching</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> When investment horizon equals Macaulay duration (duration gap = 0), reinvestment risk and price risk approximately offset each other for parallel yield shifts. If rates rise, the loss from selling the bond below its original trajectory is roughly offset by gains from reinvesting coupons at higher rates. If rates fall, the gain from selling at a premium offsets the loss from reinvesting at lower rates. This is the fundamental insight of immunization: matching duration to horizon creates a hedge against interest rate risk. The offsetting occurs because duration represents the holding period where these two countervailing forces balance. This principle is used in liability-driven investing and pension fund management to lock in returns regardless of rate changes.</p><p>B is incorrect because credit risk (default risk) is unrelated to duration matching. Duration hedges against interest rate movements, not issuer creditworthiness deterioration. Credit risk depends on the issuer's financial health, business prospects, and economic conditions affecting default probability. Duration matching provides no protection if the issuer defaults or is downgraded—that requires credit analysis, diversification, or credit derivatives.</p><p>C is incorrect because liquidity risk (inability to sell quickly without price concessions) is independent of duration matching. Liquidity depends on market depth, bid-ask spreads, and trading volume, not the relationship between duration and holding period. Duration matching addresses interest rate risk through the reinvestment/price risk offset mechanism, but it cannot protect against illiquid markets where forced selling creates transaction costs and price impacts unrelated to fundamental value.</p>"

Here \\( \\Delta P = 96 - 100 = -4 \\), so \\( \\Delta P/P = -4/100 = -0.04 = -4\\% \\), and \\( \\Delta y = 0.01 \\). Thus \\( ModDur \\approx -(-0.04) / 0.01 = 0.04 / 0.01 = 4 \\). Mental check: 4% price drop for 1% yield rise implies duration of 4. This reverse-engineering of duration from observed price changes is commonly used by traders and risk managers to calibrate models and estimate real-world sensitivities, validating theoretical duration calculations against market behavior.</p><p>A is incorrect because duration of 2 would imply only a 2% price change for a 1% yield change: \\( 2 \\times 1\\% = 2\\% \\), but the observed change is 4%. This answer halves the actual sensitivity, possibly confusing the magnitude of the price change (4 points) with the percentage change (4%) or miscalculating the ratio. Using duration of 2 would underestimate risk by 50%.</p><p>C is incorrect because duration of 8 would imply an 8% price change for a 1% yield change, double the observed 4% change. This might result from using the absolute price change (4 points) without converting to a percentage, or doubling the calculation somewhere: \\( 8 = 2 \\times 4 \\). This overstates interest rate sensitivity by a factor of 2, leading to excessive hedging or risk aversion.</p>"

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Convexity Value</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> Convexity's value arises from its asymmetric payoff: prices rise more than duration predicts when yields fall, and fall less than duration predicts when yields rise. This asymmetry is most valuable when yields move significantly and frequently (high volatility). The convexity adjustment \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times Convexity \\times (\\Delta y)^2 \\) scales with the square of yield changes, so larger moves generate disproportionately larger benefits. With volatile yields, investors repeatedly capture the convexity gain on both upward and downward moves, creating a \"gamma\" profit similar to options trading. Low-volatility environments minimize \\( (\\Delta y)^2 \\), reducing convexity's contribution. This principle explains why investors pay premiums for high-convexity bonds in uncertain rate environments.</p><p>A is incorrect because stable yields (low volatility) minimize convexity's benefit. When \\( \\Delta y \\approx 0 \\), the convexity term \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times Convexity \\times (\\Delta y)^2 \\approx 0 \\) contributes negligibly to returns. Duration provides adequate price estimates for small changes, making convexity's second-order correction irrelevant. Investors shouldn't pay much for convexity in stable environments—it's \"insurance\" that's rarely needed, making it expensive relative to benefit.</p><p>C is incorrect because credit spread widening relates to credit risk, not interest rate risk or convexity benefits. Convexity measures sensitivity to benchmark yield changes, not credit spread changes. Wider spreads reduce bond prices through higher discount rates but don't interact with convexity's mathematical properties regarding benchmark rate volatility. Credit spread changes are typically modeled separately from duration/convexity frameworks, requiring different risk measures like credit duration or DTS (duration times spread).</p>"

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Money Duration Application</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> Money duration directly measures dollar price change per 1% yield change, so reducing it by $500,000 directly achieves the goal. If current \\( MoneyDur = \\$10M \\) and target is \\( \\$9.5M \\), the manager reduces money duration by \\( \\$500k \\). This can be accomplished by selling bonds, adding short-duration bonds, or using derivatives. Money duration is the appropriate metric for position-level risk management because it translates percentage sensitivities into dollar terms, enabling direct comparison with risk limits, P&L targets, and hedge requirements. This is essential for practical risk management where absolute dollar exposures matter more than percentage sensitivities.</p><p>A is incorrect because modified duration is a percentage measure, not a dollar measure. Reducing modified duration by 5 (from, say, 6 to 1) doesn't directly specify the dollar risk reduction—the outcome depends on portfolio value. If the portfolio is $10M at MD=6, money duration is $600k (\\( 6 \\times 10M \\times 0.01 \\)). Reducing MD to 1 gives \\( 1 \\times 10M \\times 0.01 = 100k \\), a $500k reduction. But without knowing portfolio value, adjusting \"modified duration by 5\" doesn't precisely target a $500k money duration reduction.</p><p>C is incorrect because Macaulay duration measures weighted-average time (in years), not dollar risk. \"500,000 years\" is a nonsensical unit for duration. Even if this meant reducing Macaulay duration by 5 years (interpreting \"500,000\" as a typo), it still doesn't directly translate to dollar risk without knowing portfolio value and yield levels. Macaulay duration is primarily a theoretical construct; for risk management, modified or money duration is appropriate.</p>"

Higher y (discount rate) reduces present value of all cash flows. If the investor sells at the new lower price, they realize a capital loss relative to the purchase price. For example, buying at par (100) when yields are 5%, then selling after yields rise to 6%, the bond trades below par—say 95—creating a 5-point capital loss. This is pure price risk: the mark-to-market loss from adverse rate movements. This principle is fundamental to understanding bond investing: holding period shorter than maturity exposes investors to price risk from yield changes.</p><p>A is incorrect because capital gains occur when prices rise, which happens when yields fall, not rise. The question specifies rising rates, which causes falling prices. A capital gain would require selling at a price above purchase price, impossible when rates have risen and pushed prices down. This answer reverses the price-yield relationship.</p><p>C is incorrect because \"no capital gain or loss\" only occurs if: (1) the bond is held to maturity (redemption at par eliminates price risk), or (2) yields remain unchanged so the sale price equals the constant-yield trajectory. The question specifies rising rates and sale before maturity, guaranteeing a price change.

For coupon bonds, cash flows arrive before maturity (periodic coupons), so some weight is placed on times less than maturity. This pulls the weighted average below the final maturity date. For example, a 10-year bond paying annual coupons has cash flows at years 1, 2, ...10. Since weight is distributed across all years (not just year 10), the weighted average must be less than 10. Only zero-coupon bonds have all weight at maturity, making duration equal maturity. This relationship is fundamental: coupons act as \"ballast,\" anchoring duration below maturity and reducing interest rate sensitivity.</p><p>B is incorrect because having duration exceed maturity would require negative cash flows or negative weights, which don't exist for standard bonds. Duration is a weighted average of times when positive cash flows arrive; it cannot exceed the latest cash flow time (maturity). This would violate the mathematical properties of weighted averages, which must fall between the minimum and maximum values being averaged.</p><p>A is incorrect because duration equals maturity only for zero-coupon bonds (no interim cash flows) or perpetual bonds in a special limiting case.

When rates fall, coupons are reinvested at lower rates than the original YTM, reducing the future value of reinvested coupons: \\( FV_{coupons} = \\sum c \\times (1+r_{new})^{remaining} \\), where \\( r_{new} < r_{original} \\). Since total return includes both coupon and reinvestment income, lower reinvestment rates drag realized return below the original YTM.

This fundamental relationship shows that YTM equals realized return only if reinvestment occurs at the same YTM—a restrictive assumption rarely met in practice.</p><p>B is incorrect because equal returns require reinvesting coupons at exactly the original YTM. The question specifies falling rates, violating this assumption. The YTM at purchase is a promised yield contingent on specific reinvestment assumptions. When those assumptions fail (rates change), realized yield diverges from promised yield. This answer misunderstands YTM as a guaranteed return rather than a scenario-dependent expectation.</p><p>C is incorrect because higher returns occur when rates rise, not fall. Rising rates boost reinvestment income for buy-and-hold investors, increasing total return above the original YTM. Falling rates have the opposite effect, reducing reinvestment income.
