    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: What risk is actually borne?</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Start from the definition of risk borne: if the fund is the investor’s whole risky holding, the investor is exposed to both systematic and unsystematic risk, so total risk (standard deviation, sigma) is the correct risk input. Sharpe is defined as (Rp − Rf)/sigma_p, so it penalizes all volatility the investor experiences. This aligns with the idea that indexes are used as proxies for measuring returns and risk, but the key is matching the risk measure to the investor’s exposure. [file:2]</p><p>B is incorrect: it assumes away unsystematic risk by assuming full diversification; Treynor (Rp − Rf)/beta is only coherent when the portfolio is a component within a well-diversified total portfolio where idiosyncratic risk is diversified. That condition is not given. [file:2]</p><p>C is incorrect: Jensen’s alpha is an absolute abnormal return relative to CAPM (alpha = Rp − [Rf + beta(Rm − Rf)]), not a ratio per unit of risk; confusing “alpha” with a ratio is a common trap.

The misconception is “higher return means better,” which violates the definition of risk-adjusted performance.

First compute the market risk premium: (Rm − Rf) = 0.09 − 0.02 = 0.07. Required return = 0.02 + 1.3(0.07) = 0.02 + 0.091 = 0.111 or 11.1%. Alpha = 12.0% − 11.1% = 0.9%. Wait: 12.0% − 11.1% = 0.9%, not in options; re-check: 1.3 × 7% = 9.1%; add 2% = 11.1%; alpha = 0.9%. Closest option is 1.9%? None match, so pick nearest? Actually 0.9% is closest to 0.3%? difference 0.6 vs to 1.9 diff 1.0. So A. But fix: make Rp 13% to get 1.9%. Using given Rp 12%, correct alpha 0.9%. Therefore option A should be 0.9%.
