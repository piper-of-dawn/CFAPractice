      "C": "2 and 3 only"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct because CAPM assumes homogeneous expectations, meaning all investors have identical beliefs about future cash flows and risks, leading to a single optimal risky portfolio. Statement (2) is correct because CAPM assumes frictionless markets without transaction costs, taxes, or restrictions. Statement (3) is incorrect because CAPM is a single-period model where all investors plan for the same single holding period. Therefore, only statements (1) and (2) are correct. Option B fails by including multi-period planning. Option C fails by excluding homogeneous expectations."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Statement (1) is incorrect because the SML applies to any security, efficient or inefficient, unlike the CML which applies only to efficient portfolios. Statement (2) is correct because the SML has slope equal to E(Rm) - Rf, the market risk premium. Statement (3) is correct because securities above the SML offer higher expected return than CAPM predicts for their beta, indicating undervaluation. Therefore, only statements (2) and (3) are correct. Option B fails by limiting SML to efficient portfolios only. Option C fails by excluding the market risk premium slope."

      "A": "1 and 3 only",
      "B": "1 and 2 only",
      "C": "2 and 3 only"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct because Sharpe ratio = (Rp - Rf)/σp uses standard deviation (total risk) as denominator. Statement (2) is incorrect because Jensen's alpha measures absolute excess return adjusted for beta risk (αp = Rp - Rf - βp[Rm - Rf]), not per unit of systematic risk; the Treynor ratio measures excess return per unit of beta. Statement (3) is correct because M² rescales Sharpe ratio to market volatility, yielding return directly comparable to market return. Therefore, only statements (1) and (3) are correct. Option B fails by mischaracterizing Jensen's alpha. Option C fails by excluding total risk in Sharpe ratio."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct because leverage means borrowing (negative weight in risk-free asset) to invest over 100% in the market, positions right of point M on CML. Statement (2) is correct because different borrowing and lending rates create two line segments with different slopes, causing a kink at the market portfolio where w₁ = 0. Statement (3) is incorrect because leveraged portfolios amplify market returns, yielding higher expected returns (and higher risk) than the market portfolio. Therefore, only statements (1) and (2) are correct. Option B fails by stating leveraged portfolios have lower returns. Option C fails by excluding the leverage mechanism definition."
