The equation E(Rp) = Rf + [(E(Rrisky) - Rf)/σrisky] × σp shows that as you vary the weight in the risky asset, you trace out a straight line in risk-return space. Now, the key insight: not all risky portfolios are created equal. Some offer better risk-adjusted returns than others. The efficient frontier identifies portfolios with maximum return for each level of risk. When you draw a line from Rf to touch the efficient frontier, the tangency point identifies the single risky portfolio with the steepest slope—the highest Sharpe ratio [(E(R) - Rf)/σ]. This tangency portfolio is the market portfolio under CAPM assumptions (homogeneous expectations, all investors hold it). The CML is the unique CAL that uses this optimal risky portfolio. The reason correctly explains this by noting that while many CALs exist (one for each possible risky portfolio choice), only the CAL connecting Rf to the market portfolio earns the designation 'CML.'

Systematic risk stems from market-wide factors (GDP, interest rates, inflation) that affect all assets; nonsystematic risk is firm-specific (management decisions, product recalls). Now, why do CML and SML use different risk measures? The CML applies only to efficient portfolios—combinations of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio. These are fully diversified, so their only remaining risk is market risk (β). Using standard deviation (σ) is appropriate here because σ² = β²σ²(market) when nonsystematic risk is zero; total risk and systematic risk coincide. The SML, derived from CAPM, prices individual assets based on their contribution to a diversified portfolio's risk. An asset's marginal contribution is measured by Cov(Ri, Rm)/σ²(m) = βi. Even if an individual stock has high total volatility (large σ), only its systematic component (β) earns a risk premium in equilibrium because rational investors diversify away nonsystematic risk. The assertion is correct: CML plots E(R) vs. σ; SML plots E(R) vs. β. The reason is also true: well-diversified portfolios do eliminate nonsystematic risk, making σ² ≈ β²σ²(m). However, the reason does not explain why the two lines use different metrics. The true explanation is domain-specific: CML applies only to efficient (already-diversified) portfolios where σ is meaningful; SML applies to any asset, pricing only the non-diversifiable (β) component. The reason describes a property of diversified portfolios but doesn't establish why CML restricts its domain or why SML must use β for pricing."

    "explanation": "Let's build this from the ground up. The CML equation E(Rp) = Rf + [(E(Rm) - Rf)/σm] × σp has slope (E(Rm) - Rf)/σm, called the market price of risk—the reward per unit of total risk. Every point on the CML is a mix of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio, achieving maximum return for a given level of total risk. These are efficient portfolios by construction. Now consider an individual stock, say Apple. Its total risk σ(Apple) includes both systematic risk β(Apple) × σ(market) and nonsystematic risk from Apple-specific events (iPhone sales, management changes). If you plot Apple's E(R) against σ(Apple), it will typically fall below the CML. Why? Because holding Apple in isolation exposes you to σ(Apple), but the market only compensates you for β(Apple)—the portion that cannot be diversified. The CML represents portfolios where every unit of σ is priced because all σ is systematic (nonsystematic components have been diversified to zero). An individual security's σ includes 'free' risk (nonsystematic) that earns no premium, dragging its position below the CML. The reason correctly identifies this mechanism: nonsystematic risk is diversifiable, so bearing it does not improve risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio). When you hold a single stock, you're accepting uncompensated risk, lowering your E(R)/σ ratio relative to the CML. The reason directly explains why individual securities plot below the CML—they fail to achieve the efficient risk-return trade-off because part of their risk is economically 'wasted.'"

    "explanation": "Start with the CAPM equilibrium condition: E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) - Rf]. This is the SML equation—it tells you the expected return that an asset *should* earn given its systematic risk (β). The SML is a pricing benchmark derived from the assumption that investors hold the market portfolio and care only about systematic risk. Now, suppose you analyze a stock and estimate its expected return (using DCF, analyst forecasts, etc.) and find E(R) = 12%, while its β = 1.2. If Rf = 2% and E(Rm) = 8%, the SML predicts required return = 2% + 1.2(8% - 2%) = 9.2%. The stock's estimated return (12%) exceeds the required return (9.2%), so it plots above the SML. What does this mean economically? The stock's price is too low relative to its expected future cash flows. If the price were 'correct,' the expected return would equal 9.2%. The excess return (12% - 9.2% = 2.8%) is positive alpha—compensation for bearing risk already accounted for by β, implying mispricing. Buying the stock is rational because you expect it to deliver more return than its systematic risk justifies, and as other investors recognize this, buying pressure should push the price up (and expected return down) until it converges to the SML. The reason articulates this logic precisely: the SML is the equilibrium line, and positions above it indicate excess return relative to systematic risk. This directly explains why the assertion advocates purchase—you're exploiting a temporary mispricing where the market has undervalued the asset given its β."

    "explanation": "Let's trace the logic from first principles. The CML equation is E(Rp) = Rf + [(E(Rm) - Rf)/σm] × σp. When σp = 0 (zero total risk), the second term vanishes, leaving E(Rp) = Rf. This makes intuitive sense: a portfolio with zero risk is the risk-free asset itself, which by definition earns Rf. The SML equation is E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) - Rf]. When βi = 0 (zero systematic risk, no correlation with the market), the risk premium term disappears, yielding E(Ri) = Rf. Why? An asset with β = 0 doesn't move with the market; its returns are uncorrelated with systematic factors. In a diversified portfolio, such an asset contributes no systematic risk, so it cannot command a risk premium above Rf. If it offered more than Rf, investors would arbitrage: borrow at Rf, invest in the zero-beta asset, and earn riskless profit. Both lines share Rf as the intercept because Rf is the baseline return for zero risk—whether 'zero risk' means σ = 0 (CML) or β = 0 (SML). The reason correctly identifies this common foundation: no risk (of the relevant type) implies no risk premium, leaving only the time value of money (Rf). The reason explains the assertion by appealing to the universal principle that risk-free returns anchor both frameworks. Whether you measure risk by standard deviation (CML, for efficient portfolios) or beta (SML, for any asset), eliminating risk drives expected return to Rf."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Let's unpack the slopes step by step. For the CML: E(Rp) = Rf + [(E(Rm) - Rf)/σm] × σp. The slope is [E(Rm) - Rf]/σm, measured in 'percent return per percent standard deviation.' This is the Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio—it tells you how much extra expected return you earn for each additional unit of total risk (σ) you accept. It's a price: the market's going rate for bearing risk, expressed in return per volatility. For the SML: E(Ri) = Rf + [E(Rm) - Rf] × βi. The slope is [E(Rm) - Rf], the market risk premium—the excess return of the market over the risk-free rate. But notice the structure: this premium is multiplied by βi. Since beta is dimensionless (it's Cov(Ri, Rm)/σ²(m), a ratio), the slope [E(Rm) - Rf] is measured in 'percent return per unit of beta.' When βi = 1 (market-level systematic risk), you earn the full market premium; when βi = 2, you earn twice the premium. The assertion is correct: the CML slope prices total risk (σ), while the SML slope is the market premium that scales with β. The reason explains this distinction clearly: the CML slope has dimensions of return/risk (Sharpe ratio), while the SML slope is return itself (the market premium), with beta as the multiplier. The reason provides the mathematical and dimensional foundation that clarifies why the two slopes have different interpretations—one is a unit price (CML), the other is a total premium (SML) that gets scaled by the beta coefficient."

Point M (the market itself) lies on the CML with coordinates [σm, E(Rm)]. The SML plots E(R) vs. β and applies to all assets. Since beta measures an asset's covariance with the market scaled by market variance—βi = Cov(Ri, Rm)/σ²(m)—the market's beta with itself is Cov(Rm, Rm)/σ²(m) = σ²(m)/σ²(m) = 1. Plugging βm = 1 into the SML equation E(R) = Rf + β[E(Rm) - Rf] gives E(Rm) = Rf + 1 × [E(Rm) - Rf] = E(Rm), confirming the market portfolio sits on the SML at coordinates [1, E(Rm)]. Now, why is M the *only* risky asset on both lines? The CML restricts its domain to efficient portfolios (the market portfolio and its leveraged/deleveraged versions). Individual securities and inefficient portfolios lie below the CML because they contain uncompensated nonsystematic risk. However, *all* assets—efficient or not—lie on the SML in equilibrium, as the SML prices assets based solely on their beta (systematic risk). The market portfolio is special: it's the tangency portfolio (CML) and it has β = 1 (SML). Other efficient portfolios (like 50% Rf + 50% M) lie on the CML but have β ≠ 1 (β = 0.5 in this case), placing them elsewhere on the SML. Individual stocks lie on the SML (at their respective betas) but below the CML (due to nonsystematic risk). Only M satisfies both CML membership (efficiency) and the SML coordinate [β = 1, E(Rm)]. The reason correctly explains this: βm = 1 by construction, and M is the unique tangency portfolio that defines the CML. These two properties together ensure M is the intersection point of the two frameworks."

This is the most general case - the risky portfolio can be anything: a single stock, a bond portfolio, or any combination of risky assets. Statement (2) is correct. The CAL's slope is (E(Rp) - Rf)/σp, which is precisely the Sharpe ratio - the reward-to-variability ratio. This slope tells us how much additional expected return we earn per unit of additional risk taken. A steeper CAL means better risk-return tradeoff. Statement (3) is correct.

The CAL uses total risk (standard deviation, σ) on the horizontal axis, NOT beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk only and is used in the Security Market Line (SML), not the CAL.

Under the assumption of homogeneous expectations, all investors identify the same optimal risky portfolio, which is the market portfolio. Statement (2) is incorrect, and this is critical for understanding the CML's limitation. The CML applies ONLY to efficient portfolios (combinations of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio). Individual securities or inefficient portfolios will plot BELOW the CML. For example, a single stock has unsystematic risk that hasn't been diversified away, so it won't lie on the CML. This is a key difference from the SML, which applies to all securities. Statement (3) is correct. The CML, like the CAL, assumes frictionless markets where investors can both lend (invest in risk-free assets) and borrow (leverage) at the same risk-free rate. This assumption allows the line to extend beyond the market portfolio - investors can borrow at Rf to invest more than 100% in the market portfolio, moving right along the CML to higher risk-return combinations. Statement (4) is correct. Every point on the CML is efficient because it represents the best possible risk-return tradeoff available by combining the risk-free asset with the market portfolio.

The CAPM's insight is that in equilibrium, investors are only compensated for systematic risk because unsystematic risk can be diversified away. Statement (2) is incorrect, and this is THE fundamental difference between CML and SML. The SML uses beta (systematic risk) on the horizontal axis, NOT total risk (standard deviation). Beta measures how much an asset's returns co-move with the market: βi = Cov(Ri,Rm)/σ²m. This is crucial because it means the SML captures only the non-diversifiable risk component. An asset might have high total risk (high σ) but if most of that risk is unsystematic (diversifiable), it will have a low beta and plot close to the risk-free rate on the SML. Statement (3) is correct, and this distinguishes the SML from the CML. The SML applies to ANY security or portfolio - efficient or inefficient, diversified or undiversified. Why? Because beta can be calculated for any asset. Even a single stock that's far from efficient will have a beta and should plot on (or near, if mispriced) the SML. This universality makes the SML more practical for security analysis than the CML. Statement (4) is correct. The SML's slope is [E(Rm) - Rf], the market risk premium - the extra return investors demand for bearing market risk. For each unit increase in beta, expected return increases by the market risk premium. If the market risk premium is 7%, an asset with β = 1.5 should earn 7% × 1.5 = 10.5% above the risk-free rate.

    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct. Both the CAL and CML use total risk (standard deviation, σ) as the risk measure on the horizontal axis. This makes sense because they deal with portfolio combinations that may include both systematic and unsystematic risk. The formula for both is E(Rp) = Rf + [(E(Rm) - Rf)/σm] × σp, where risk is measured by σp. The key difference between CAL and CML is not the risk measure but which risky portfolio is used (any portfolio for CAL, market portfolio for CML). Statement (2) is correct. The SML uses beta (systematic risk) precisely because it's derived from CAPM, which assumes investors hold well-diversified portfolios. In a well-diversified portfolio, unsystematic risk is diversified away to near-zero, leaving only systematic risk. Since investors can eliminate unsystematic risk costlessly through diversification, they're not compensated for bearing it - only systematic risk (beta) is priced. This is the equilibrium condition: E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) - Rf]. Statement (3) is incorrect. An inefficient portfolio will NOT plot on the CML - it will plot BELOW the CML. The CML contains only efficient portfolios (combinations of risk-free asset and market portfolio). However, the inefficient portfolio WILL plot on (or near) the SML, because every asset has a beta and the SML applies universally to all securities and portfolios. This illustrates that CML is restrictive (efficient portfolios only) while SML is comprehensive (all assets). Statement (4) is incorrect. The CML and SML will NOT rank portfolios identically. Consider two portfolios with the same standard deviation: Portfolio A (well-diversified, high beta) and Portfolio B (poorly-diversified, low beta but high unsystematic risk). On the CML space (risk vs return using σ), they appear at the same risk level. But on the SML (beta vs return), Portfolio A plots farther right (higher beta) and should have higher return. The rankings differ because the risk measures differ. Therefore, statements (1) and (2) are correct. Option B fails by including the incorrect statement about inefficient portfolios on the CML. Option C fails by excluding the correct statement about risk measurement and including the incorrect ranking statement."

    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct. The CAL is the most basic and general concept - any investor can construct a CAL by combining the risk-free asset with their chosen risky portfolio. No special assumptions are needed about market efficiency, homogeneous expectations, or CAPM. If you hold a portfolio of three stocks and Treasury bills, you have a CAL. It's simply the mathematical result of combining a zero-risk asset with any risky asset. Statement (2) is correct. The CML requires stronger assumptions, particularly homogeneous expectations. Here's why: if all investors have identical expectations about expected returns, variances, and covariances, they'll all calculate the same efficient frontier and identify the same tangency portfolio (market portfolio). This creates a UNIQUE CML that all investors face. Without homogeneous expectations, different investors would identify different 'optimal' risky portfolios, creating different tangency points and different CMLs - there would be no single CML. The CML is therefore a market equilibrium concept requiring agreement among investors. Statement (3) is incorrect. The SML applies to ALL securities and portfolios, whether they're in the market portfolio or not. This is powerful: you can use the SML to evaluate any asset - a small cap stock not in major indices, a new IPO, a private equity investment, even a portfolio you're considering constructing. As long as you can estimate beta (covariance with the market), you can locate the asset on the SML and determine if it's fairly priced. The universality of the SML makes it a practical tool for security selection. Statement (4) is correct. Securities plotting above the SML offer higher expected return than CAPM predicts for their level of systematic risk (beta). This means they're undervalued - they're giving you more return than required for the risk borne. An active manager would want to buy such securities (positive alpha). Conversely, securities below the SML are overvalued, offering insufficient return for their beta. The SML represents the fair-value relationship; deviations indicate mispricing opportunities. Therefore, statements (1), (2), and (4) are correct. Option B fails by including statement (3) which incorrectly limits SML applicability. Option C fails by excluding the fundamental generality of the CAL."

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct. The CML is indeed the CAL with the maximum possible Sharpe ratio. Here's the logic: Among all possible risky portfolios an investor could choose, the market portfolio (tangency portfolio) offers the best risk-return tradeoff - it has the highest Sharpe ratio. When you construct a CAL using any sub-optimal risky portfolio, its slope (Sharpe ratio) will be lower than the CML's slope. The CML represents the dominant CAL - no other CAL can plot above it. Graphically, the CML is tangent to the efficient frontier at the market portfolio, and any other line from Rf would intersect the frontier at a lower slope. This is why all investors (under homogeneous expectations) choose the CML. Statement (2) is correct, though subtle. Every portfolio on the CML is efficient and has a specific beta. For example, a portfolio of 60% risk-free asset and 40% market portfolio has β = 0.4 (since βmarket = 1 and βrf = 0). This portfolio appears on the CML at its total risk level (σp) and also plots on the SML at β = 0.4. Both lines give the same expected return for this efficient portfolio. However, inefficient portfolios appear below the CML but still on the SML. The CML and SML converge for efficient portfolios. Statement (3) is correct. All three lines - CAL, CML, and SML - have the risk-free rate (Rf) as the y-intercept. This makes intuitive sense: when risk is zero (σ = 0 for CAL/CML, or β = 0 for SML), the expected return must be the risk-free rate. At zero risk, there's no uncertainty, so you earn exactly Rf. This common starting point reflects that all three frameworks begin with the risk-free asset as the foundation. Statement (4) is incorrect. The CML and SML cannot be meaningfully compared in terms of 'slope' because they use different x-axis measures. The CML's slope is (E(Rm) - Rf)/σm (units: return per unit of standard deviation), while the SML's slope is (E(Rm) - Rf) (units: return per unit of beta). These are dimensionally different - like comparing miles per hour with meters per second. At the market portfolio, where σm corresponds to βm = 1, we can note that CML slope uses σm as denominator while SML slope has no denominator, but this doesn't make one 'steeper' in a comparable way. Therefore, statements (1), (2), and (3) are correct. Option B fails by including statement (4) about incomparable slopes. Option C fails by excluding the Sharpe ratio optimization concept."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct. When an investor selects a specific risky portfolio based on personal research, preferences, or constraints - say, a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks or ESG-screened companies - they're creating their own CAL. They decide the risky portfolio composition, then determine how much to allocate between that risky portfolio and the risk-free asset based on their risk tolerance. The CAL framework helps them understand the risk-return tradeoff of their specific portfolio choice. This is the most general application: any custom portfolio plus cash creates a CAL. Statement (2) is correct. A passive investor who holds a market index fund (like an S&P 500 fund) is effectively holding the market portfolio. When they combine this with risk-free assets (or leverage by borrowing), they're moving along the CML. For example, a 70-30 portfolio of S&P 500 index fund and Treasury bills places the investor 70% of the way from Rf toward the market portfolio on the CML. This is the classic passive strategy recommended by the CML framework - hold the market and adjust risk through the risk-free asset allocation. Statement (3) is correct. This is the primary practical application of the SML in active management. Analysts estimate a security's beta and use CAPM/SML to calculate the required return: E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) - Rf]. They then compare this to their forecast of the security's expected return. If their forecast exceeds the SML prediction, the security plots above the SML (positive alpha) and is a buy candidate. If below, it's a sell candidate. The SML provides the benchmark for fair value, and deviations represent potential mispricings to exploit. Statement (4) is incorrect. The CAL is actually LESS useful than the SML for evaluating individual stocks. Here's why: A single stock has both systematic and unsystematic risk. The CAL/CML framework uses total risk (standard deviation), which includes unsystematic risk. But unsystematic risk isn't priced - investors don't get compensated for it because it can be diversified away. The SML, by using beta (systematic risk only), correctly identifies what portion of the stock's risk matters for pricing. An analyst using the CAL might reject a high-volatility stock, but if most of that volatility is diversifiable, the SML would correctly show it's acceptably priced for its beta. The SML is the appropriate tool for individual security evaluation. Therefore, statements (1), (2), and (3) are correct. Option B fails by including statement (4) which incorrectly prioritizes CAL over SML for stock evaluation. Option C fails by excluding the custom portfolio CAL application."

Every investor can split their wealth between two fundamental choices: a risk-free asset (like Treasury bills) and a risky portfolio.</p><h3>Building Block 1: The Risk-Return Trade-off</h3><p>When you invest 100% in the risk-free asset, you get a certain return $R_f$ with zero risk. When you invest 100% in the risky portfolio, you get an expected return $E(R_p)$ but must bear risk measured by standard deviation $\\sigma_p$. By varying the allocation between these two, you create a continuum of portfolios.</p><h3>Building Block 2: The Linear Relationship</h3><p>Because the risk-free asset has zero standard deviation and zero correlation with the risky portfolio, any combination creates a <em>straight line</em> in risk-return space. This line is the Capital Allocation Line (CAL). The CAL equation is:</p><p>$$E(R_{portfolio}) = R_f + \\frac{E(R_p) - R_f}{\\sigma_p} \\times \\sigma_{portfolio}$$</p><p>The slope of this line represents the <em>reward per unit of risk</em> — how much additional expected return you receive for each 1% increase in risk you accept. This is also called the Sharpe ratio of the risky portfolio.</p><h3>Building Block 3: Computing the Slope</h3><p>The slope is:</p><p>$$Slope_{CAL} = \\frac{E(R_p) - R_f}{\\sigma_p}$$</p><p>This measures the <em>excess return per unit of risk</em>.

This distinguishes it from the CML (which we'll see later), where all investors hold the same optimal risky portfolio—the market portfolio.</p><p><strong>B is incorrect</strong> because it likely divides by a different risk measure or uses the total portfolio return instead of the excess return (risk premium).</p><p><strong>C is incorrect</strong> because it appears to invert the formula or double the correct value, misunderstanding that slope measures return per unit of risk, not risk per unit of return.</p>"

Substituting:</p><p>$$0.09 = w \\times 0.11 + (1 - w) \\times 0.03$$</p><h3>Building Block 3: Solving for the Weight</h3><p>Expand the equation:</p><p>$$0.09 = 0.11w + 0.03 - 0.03w$$</p><p>$$0.09 = 0.08w + 0.03$$</p><p>$$0.09 - 0.03 = 0.08w$$</p><p>$$0.06 = 0.08w$$</p><p>$$w = \\frac{0.06}{0.08} = 0.75 = 75\\%$$</p><h3>Building Block 4: Verification and Intuition</h3><p>Let's verify this makes sense:</p><ul><li>Portfolio return: $0.75(0.11) + 0.25(0.03) = 0.0825 + 0.0075 = 0.09$ ✓</li><li>The desired 9% return is $\\frac{9\\% - 3\\%}{11\\% - 3\\%} = \\frac{6\\%}{8\\%} = 0.75$ of the way from the risk-free rate to the market return</li></ul><p>Intuition: The market offers an 8% premium over the risk-free rate (11% - 3%). The investor wants a 6% premium (9% - 3%). Therefore, they need 6/8 = 75% exposure to the market.</p><h3>Building Block 5: Portfolio Risk</h3><p>As a bonus insight, we can calculate this portfolio's risk:</p><p>$$\\sigma_p = w \\times \\sigma_m = 0.75 \\times 0.20 = 0.15 = 15\\%$$</p><p>This portfolio has 75% of the market's risk and earns 75% of the market's risk premium — demonstrating the linear risk-return relationship on the CML.</p><h3>Stitching It Together: CML as a Mixing Line</h3><p>The CML represents a continuum of portfolios created by mixing the risk-free asset and the market portfolio in different proportions:</p><ul><li><strong>100% risk-free</strong>: Return = 3%, Risk = 0%</li><li><strong>75% market, 25% risk-free</strong>: Return = 9%, Risk = 15%</li><li><strong>100% market</strong>: Return = 11%, Risk = 20%</li><li><strong>125% market (borrow at risk-free rate)</strong>: Return = 13%, Risk = 25%</li></ul><p>The CML's linearity makes calculations straightforward: returns and risks scale proportionally with the weight in the market portfolio.</p><p><strong>A is incorrect</strong> because 55% would yield a return of $0.55(0.11) + 0.45(0.03) = 0.0605 + 0.0135 = 0.074 = 7.4\\%$, falling short of the 9% target.</p><p><strong>C is incorrect</strong> because 82% would yield a return of $0.82(0.11) + 0.18(0.03) = 0.0902 + 0.0054 = 0.0956 = 9.56\\%$, overshooting the 9% target.</p>"

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles: The Complete Integration</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> This question synthesizes everything we've learned. Let's evaluate each statement by building from foundational principles.</p><h3>Statement I: \"The CML has a steeper slope than the SML because it uses total risk instead of systematic risk.\"</h3><h3>Analysis: This statement is INCORRECT and reveals a fundamental misunderstanding.</h3><p><strong>The Problem with Comparing Slopes:</strong> The CML and SML have <em>different x-axes</em>, making direct slope comparisons meaningless:</p><ul><li>CML plots expected return vs. <em>standard deviation</em> (units: %)</li><li>SML plots expected return vs. <em>beta</em> (units: dimensionless)</li></ul><p>You cannot compare the numerical values of these slopes any more than you can compare miles per gallon to kilometers per liter without conversion. They measure different things.</p><p><strong>What we CAN say:</strong></p><ul><li>CML slope = $\\frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\\sigma_m}$ = Sharpe ratio of market (e.g., 0.40 if market premium is 8% and market risk is 20%)</li><li>SML slope = $E(R_m) - R_f$ = market risk premium (e.g., 8%)</li></ul><p>Numerically, the CML slope (0.40) is <em>smaller</em> than the SML slope (8.0), but this comparison is meaningless because they have different units and x-axes.</p><h3>Statement II: \"A portfolio consisting of 70% market portfolio and 30% risk-free asset will plot on both the CML and the SML.\"</h3><h3>Analysis: This statement is CORRECT — demonstrating a deep insight.</h3><p><strong>Why it plots on the CML:</strong> By definition, any combination of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio lies on the CML. This portfolio is exactly such a combination, so it must lie on the CML.</p><p><strong>Why it plots on the SML:</strong> The SML applies to <em>all</em> assets and portfolios. This portfolio has a beta that can be calculated:</p><p>$$\\beta_p = 0.70 \\times \\beta_m + 0.30 \\times \\beta_{rf} = 0.70 \\times 1.0 + 0.30 \\times 0 = 0.70$$</p><p>Using the SML equation with $\\beta = 0.70$:</p><p>$$E(R_p) = R_f + 0.70 \\times [E(R_m) - R_f]$$</p><p>Using the CML equation with $\\sigma_p = 0.70 \\times \\sigma_m$:</p><p>$$E(R_p) = R_f + \\frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\\sigma_m} \\times 0.70\\sigma_m = R_f + 0.70 \\times [E(R_m) - R_f]$$</p><p>Both equations give the same expected return! This is not a coincidence — for <em>efficient portfolios</em> (those on the CML), the SML and CML are consistent. This is because efficient portfolios have no unsystematic risk, so their total risk is entirely systematic.</p><h3>Statement III: \"The market portfolio has a Sharpe ratio equal to the slope of the CML and a beta of 1.0 on the SML.\"</h3><h3>Analysis: This statement is CORRECT — capturing a fundamental unity.</h3><p><strong>Part 1: Sharpe Ratio equals CML Slope</strong></p><p>The market portfolio's Sharpe ratio is:</p><p>$$Sharpe_m = \\frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\\sigma_m}$$</p><p>The CML slope is:</p><p>$$Slope_{CML} = \\frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\\sigma_m}$$</p><p>These are identical. In fact, the CML slope <em>is defined</em> as the Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio. Every investor on the CML achieves the same Sharpe ratio as the market portfolio (this is the power of the two-fund separation theorem).</p><p><strong>Part 2: Beta equals 1.0</strong></p><p>Beta measures systematic risk relative to the market. By definition:</p><p>$$\\beta_m = \\frac{Cov(R_m, R_m)}{Var(R_m)} = \\frac{Var(R_m)}{Var(R_m)} = 1.0$$</p><p>The market has perfect correlation with itself, so its beta is exactly 1.0. On the SML, the market portfolio plots at the point (β = 1.0, Return = $E(R_m)$).</p><h3>Stitching It All Together: The Grand Unification</h3><p>The CAL, CML, and SML are not separate theories — they are different perspectives on the same equilibrium:</p><p><strong>The CAL</strong> says: Investors combine safe and risky assets.</p><p><strong>The CML</strong> says: In equilibrium, the optimal risky asset is the market; it prices <em>efficient</em> portfolios.</p><p><strong>The SML</strong> says: Only systematic risk is priced; it prices <em>all</em> assets, efficient or not.</p><p>For the special case of efficient portfolios (those on the CML), both the CML and SML apply simultaneously and give consistent results. For inefficient assets (like individual stocks), only the SML applies.</p><p><strong>A is incorrect</strong> because Statement I is false — you cannot meaningfully compare CML and SML slopes due to different x-axis units.</p><p><strong>C is incorrect</strong> because Statement I is false for the reason explained above.</p>"
