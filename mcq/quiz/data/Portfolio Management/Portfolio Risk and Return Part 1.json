      "A": "1 and 2 only",
      "B": "1 and 3 only",
      "C": "2 and 3 only"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct because the CAL is formed by combinations of risk-free and risky assets. Statement (2) is correct because slope is (ER_i - Rf)/σ_i, the reward-to-variability ratio. Statement (3) is incorrect because points below CAL offer lower return for same risk, making them inefficient. Therefore, only statements (1) and (2) are correct. Option B fails by calling below-CAL points efficient. Option C fails by excluding the definition of CAL."

    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct because σ_p² = w1²σ1² + w2²σ2² + 2 w1 w2 Cov(R1,R2). Statement (2) is correct because when ρ=1, σ_p = w1 σ1 + w2 σ2. Statement (3) is incorrect because only true when perfectly correlated; otherwise, risk is less. Therefore, only statements (1) and (2) are correct. Option B fails by including the always-weighted-average misconception. Option C fails by excluding the covariance necessity."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct because portfolio risk falls below weighted average when ρ < 1. Statement (2) is correct because opposite movements allow risk elimination. Statement (3) is incorrect because correlation cannot exceed 1 and higher values reduce diversification. Therefore, only statements (1) and (2) are correct. Option B fails by including impossible correlation greater than 1. Option C fails by excluding risk reduction with low correlation."

    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct because individual variances become negligible, leaving average covariance. Statement (2) is correct because portfolio risk depends primarily on average correlation in large portfolios. Statement (3) is incorrect because expected return remains weighted average, unaffected by diversification. Therefore, only statements (1) and (2) are correct. Option B fails by claiming diversification boosts return. Option C fails by excluding the variance-covariance relation."
