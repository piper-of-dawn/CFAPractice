    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Best Effort Offering Risk</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> In a **best effort offering**, the investment bank acts only as a broker (agent) and makes no guarantee of sale[cite: 32, 101]. If the offering is undersubscribed (not enough demand at the set price), the **issuer will not sell as much as it hoped to sell**[cite: 33]. This exposes the issuer to the risk of failing to raise the desired amount of capital. In an underwritten offering, this risk is borne by the bank [cite: 27].</p><p>A is incorrect: The incentive to set a low price is the primary risk for the *underwriter* in an underwritten offering, as it reduces the potential gross proceeds for the issuer [cite: 40].</p><p>C is incorrect: The bank is **not** required to buy unsold securities in a best effort offering; that is the defining commitment of an underwritten offering[cite: 27, 32].</p>"

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Pricing Outcomes</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> The issuer and the investment bank jointly set the offering price[cite: 34]. If they set a price that buyers consider **too high**, the offering will be **undersubscribed**, meaning they will fail to sell the entire issue at that price[cite: 35]. Conversely, if the price is set too low, the offering will be oversubscribed [cite: 36].</p><p>A is incorrect: Setting the price **too low** will result in the offering being **oversubscribed**, not undersubscribed [cite: 36].</p><p>C is incorrect: The underwriter's market-making commitment (providing liquidity/price support after the IPO) is a related service, but the initial undersubscription is a consequence of the price being too high relative to market demand[cite: 28, 35].</p>"
