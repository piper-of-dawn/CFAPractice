    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Book Value Reliability</h3><p><strong>C is correct.</strong> P/B is most meaningful when book value approximates market value. Financial institutions hold liquid assets (loans, securities) often marked-to-market or carried near fair value, making book value a reliable proxy for economic capital. The accounting for financial assets creates alignment between book and market values, making P/B comparisons across banks valid and informative for relative valuation.</p><p>A is incorrect because internally developed intangibles (IP, R&D) are often expensed, not capitalized, causing book value to significantly understate economic capital.</p><p>B is incorrect because service firms' primary value driver is human capital, which doesn't appear on the balance sheet, rendering book value largely irrelevant.</p>"

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Relative Valuation Principle</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> The Law of One Price states that identical assets should sell for identical prices in efficient markets. The method of comparables applies this by comparing similar companies' multiples. If two firms have similar risk, growth, and profitability profiles, they should trade at similar P/E, EV/EBITDA, etc. Deviations suggest mispricing. This principle creates the foundation for relative valuation without requiring explicit cash flow forecasts.</p><p>B is incorrect; EMH addresses information efficiency and whether prices reflect all available information, not specifically the relative pricing of similar assets.</p><p>C is incorrect; CAPM estimates required returns based on systematic risk (beta), not comparative valuation across firms with similar characteristics.</p>"

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Modeling Growth Transitions</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> The Two-Stage DDM captures firms transitioning from an initial high-growth phase to a mature stable-growth phase. Stage 1 models finite high growth (gS), Stage 2 models perpetual sustainable growth (gL) using the Gordon model for terminal value. This structure aligns with corporate life cycles where growth rates naturally decline as markets mature, competition increases, and investment opportunities diminish, making it ideal for growth-to-maturity transitions.</p><p>A is incorrect; mature companies with stable perpetual growth are better valued with the simpler single-stage Gordon Growth Model, which is a special case of the two-stage model with no high-growth period.</p><p>C is incorrect; start-ups with no near-term dividends require FCFE models or multi-stage DDMs with long no-dividend periods, making DDM inputs highly uncertain and unreliable.</p>"
