    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct. In a price-weighted index, the weight of each constituent is determined by its price. Stock A (USD 100) has a much higher weight than Stock B (USD 20). Therefore, a percentage change in the higher-priced stock (Stock A) contributes more to the index return than the same percentage change in the lower-priced stock. Statement (2) is incorrect. A stock split reduces the price of the stock (e.g., from USD 100 to USD 50). To keep the index value constant despite the drop in the sum of constituent prices, the divisor must be decreased, not increased. Statement (3) is correct. The weight of Stock A is calculated as Price A / (Price A + Price B) = 100 / (100 + 20) = 100/120 = 0.833 or 83.3%. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because it includes the false statement regarding the divisor adjustment direction. Option C is incorrect for the same reason."

In the market-cap index, SmallCap has a weight of roughly 0.8% (1/121). A doubling of the SmallCap stock drives the equal-weighted index significantly higher, whereas it has a negligible impact on the market-cap index. Thus, the equal-weighted index outperforms. Statement (3) is incorrect. An equal-weighted index allocates weight equally: 1/N. With 3 stocks, LargeCap receives 33.3% weight, not 82%. The 82% figure approximates its weight in the market-cap index (100/121). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."

Stocks with lower prices relative to these metrics (value stocks) get higher weights than in market-cap indexes, creating a value tilt. Statement (3) is incorrect. The fundamental weight depends on the fundamental metric (Earnings). If earnings are unchanged, the numerator (Stock X Earnings) and denominator (Total Earnings) remain constant, so the weight remains constant.
