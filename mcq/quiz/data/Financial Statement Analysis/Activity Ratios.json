    "options": {
      "A": "Apple's DOH is negative because it sells products before purchasing inventory.",
      "B": "Apple's days payable (112 days) exceeds the sum of DOH (9 days) and DSO (27 days).",
      "C": "Apple has a negative DSO because customers pay in advance."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Exceptional Working Capital Management</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> The text's Example 9 shows Apple FY2017: DSO = 27, DOH = 9, Days Payable = 112. Cash conversion cycle = 27 + 9 − 112 = −76 days. The text explains: 'Apple takes advantage of the favorable credit terms granted by its suppliers. The overall effect is a negative cash cycle... Instead of requiring additional capital to fund working capital as is the case for most companies, Apple has excess cash to invest for over 50 days.' Days payable exceeding the sum of DOH and DSO creates the negative cycle.</p><p>A is incorrect because DOH cannot be negative—it measures how long inventory sits, which is always a positive number of days. Apple's DOH is positive (9 days), just very low due to outsourced manufacturing and lean inventory.</p><p>C is incorrect because DSO also cannot be negative in standard interpretation. It measures collection time, which is positive. Apple's DSO of 27 days is positive and normal; the negative cash cycle comes from extraordinarily long payment terms with suppliers (112 days).</p>"
