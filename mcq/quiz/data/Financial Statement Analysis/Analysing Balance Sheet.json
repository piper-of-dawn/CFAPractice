When NRV declines below cost, a write-down occurs. The divergence arises in the recovery. Under IFRS, if the circumstances causing the write-down cease to exist, the write-down is reversed. However, the reversal is limited to the amount of the original write-down (the inventory cannot be carried above its original cost). Therefore, the $1.2 million recovery is capped at the $1 million original loss. Under US GAAP, inventory write-downs are permanent; a new cost basis is established, and no reversal is permitted until the sale occurs. Thus, IFRS recognizes $1 million, GAAP recognizes $0.</p><p>B is incorrect: IFRS caps the reversal at the original write-down amount ($1M), not the full market recovery ($1.2M).

Development costs differ: IFRS requires capitalization if feasibility criteria are met (creating an asset), while US GAAP generally requires expensing (except for software). Capitalized expenditures are treated as Investing Cash Flows (CFI), whereas expensed costs are Operating Cash Flows (CFO). Therefore, under IFRS, the $8 million development cost is an outflow in CFI.
