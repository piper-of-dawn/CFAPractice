Earnings Quality refers to the sustainability and adequacy of the economic return (is the truth good?). Here, the reporting is compliant and useful, so reporting quality is high. However, the earnings come from non-recurring sources (one-off sales), meaning they are not sustainable and have low predictive value for future cash flows.

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Accounting Conservatism</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Start with the accounting equation. Expensing a cost immediately reduces Net Income in the current period (Revenue - Expenses = Income) compared to capitalizing it (which puts it on the Balance Sheet). Lower Net Income reduces Retained Earnings. In future periods, because the asset is not on the balance sheet, there is no depreciation or amortization expense associated with it. Therefore, future expenses are lower, mechanically increasing future earnings potential. This shift from current to future is the hallmark of conservative accounting.</p><p>B is incorrect: This describes aggressive accounting (capitalizing costs to boost current income).</p><p>C is incorrect: The decision to expense vs. capitalize is an accounting classification choice; the actual cash outflow occurs regardless. If expensed, it hits CFO; if capitalized, it typically hits CFI.
