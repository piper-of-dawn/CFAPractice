Under IFRS (IAS 23), when an entity borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization are the actual borrowing costs incurred on that borrowing during the period less any investment income on the temporary investment of those borrowings. This netting is permitted because IFRS focuses on the net cost to the entity. Statement (2) is incorrect. Under US GAAP (ASC 835-20), interest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings is generally not netted against interest cost eligible for capitalization. The full amount of interest cost incurred is subject to capitalization (up to the avoidable interest amount), and the investment income is recognized as revenue. US GAAP does not allow this netting, creating a divergence from IFRS. Statement (3) is correct. Both frameworks operate under the principle that borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a qualifying asset form part of the cost of that asset. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Therefore, statements (1) and (3) are correct.

This is a conservative approach designed to avoid capitalizing assets with uncertain future benefits. Statement (2) is correct. IFRS (IAS 38) distinguishes between the research phase and the development phase. Research costs are always expensed. However, development costs must be capitalized if the entity can demonstrate technical feasibility, intention to complete, ability to use or sell the asset, and the availability of resources, among other criteria. Statement (3) is correct. US GAAP has a specific exception for software development costs. For software to be sold, leased, or marketed to others, costs incurred after 'technological feasibility' has been established but before general release to the public are capitalized. This creates a specific pocket of capitalization within the general R&D expense rule. Statement (4) is incorrect.

Capitalizing an expenditure increases Net Income in the initial year (because the full expense is removed, replaced by a smaller depreciation expense) and increases Total Assets (because the cost is added to the balance sheet). Mathematically, the percentage increase in Net Income (numerator) is typically much larger than the percentage increase in Total Assets (denominator), resulting in a higher ROA in the initial year compared to expensing. Statement (2) is correct. Capitalizing increases Net Income, which flows to Retained Earnings, thereby increasing Total Equity. Since Total Equity is the denominator in the Debt-to-Equity ratio, a higher denominator leads to a lower ratio. Expensing would reduce Equity more significantly, leading to a higher ratio. Statement (3) is incorrect. The Interest Coverage ratio is EBIT / Interest Expense. If the expenditure is capitalized, EBIT is higher (because the operating expense is removed). Interest expense remains the same (assuming the expenditure itself wasn't interest). A higher EBIT with constant Interest Expense leads to a higher, not lower, Interest Coverage ratio.

    "explanation": "Statement (1) is correct. In an inflationary environment (rising prices), FIFO assigns the older, cheaper costs to COGS and the newer, more expensive costs to ending inventory. Lower COGS results in higher Net Income. LIFO does the opposite, assigning newer, higher costs to COGS, reducing Net Income. Statement (2) is correct. IFRS (IAS 2) does not permit the use of the LIFO method due to the potential for balance sheet distortion (inventory values becoming outdated) and income manipulation. US GAAP permits LIFO. Statement (3) is incorrect. In a period of falling prices (deflation), FIFO assigns older, more expensive costs to COGS. Weighted Average mixes these with newer, cheaper costs. Therefore, FIFO would have a higher COGS, and Weighted Average would have a relatively lower COGS compared to FIFO? No, let's re-evaluate. Falling prices: Oldest costs are high. Newest costs are low. FIFO takes oldest (high) to COGS. Weighted Avg takes a mix (medium). So FIFO COGS > WAC COGS. Wait, the statement says WAC results in lower COGS than FIFO. If FIFO is high and WAC is medium, then WAC is indeed lower than FIFO. Let's trace again. Deflation. Inventory: USD10 (old), USD8, USD6 (new). FIFO COGS = USD10. WAC COGS = USD8. USD8 < USD10. So WAC results in lower COGS than FIFO. Statement (3) is effectively saying WAC < FIFO. This is correct. Let me re-read the options. Option A excludes 3. Option B excludes 1. Option C excludes 4. Let's check statement 4. Statement (4) is correct. This is the 'LIFO conformity rule' in the US. If a company uses LIFO to reduce its taxable income, it must also use LIFO for its financial statements. Okay, I need to check my logic on Statement 3 again carefully. Rising prices: FIFO COGS < WAC COGS < LIFO COGS. Falling prices: FIFO COGS > WAC COGS > LIFO COGS. So in falling prices, FIFO COGS is the highest. WAC COGS is lower than FIFO. So Statement (3) 'Weighted Average Cost method results in a lower Cost of Goods Sold compared to the FIFO method' is mathematically correct. However, usually questions focus on rising prices. Let's look at the options. If 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all correct, I have no option. Let me re-read Statement 3. 'In a period of falling prices...' FIFO sells old (expensive) stuff. COGS is High. WAC sells average stuff. COGS is Medium. LIFO sells new (cheap) stuff. COGS is Low. So FIFO > WAC > LIFO. WAC is indeed lower than FIFO. Is there a trick? Maybe 'lower' implies the lowest? No. Okay, is Statement 1 correct? Rising prices. FIFO sells cheap stuff. COGS Low. NI High. Yes. Statement 2 Correct? Yes. Statement 4 Correct? Yes. So 1, 2, 4 are definitely correct. Statement 3 is also technically correct. This implies a flaw in my question construction or option set unless one statement is subtle. Let's reconsider Statement 3. Is it possible for WAC to be higher? Only if purchase volumes fluctuate wildly. But generally, the trend holds. Let's assume the question implies 'consistently' or 'generally'. Wait, maybe Statement 4 is the key. The LIFO conformity rule is a tax rule, not strictly an accounting standard principle, but it is a constraint on financial reporting. It is widely taught in this context. Let's look at Statement 1 again. 'Higher Net Income'. Yes, lower COGS = Higher NI. Is there a tax effect? Higher NI = Higher Tax. But Pre-tax income is higher. The statement says 'Net Income'. Higher taxes would reduce the 'Higher' amount but wouldn't flip it unless tax > 100%. So 1 is correct. Let's look at options again. A: 1, 2, 4. B: 2, 3, 4. C: 1, 2, 3. The only way A is the answer is if 3 is wrong. Why would 3 be wrong? 'In a period of falling prices, the Weighted Average Cost method results in a lower Cost of Goods Sold compared to the FIFO method.' FIFO takes the oldest (highest price). WAC takes the average. Average < Max. So WAC < FIFO. The statement is true. Why would it be false? Ah, if the company sells MORE than it purchased, it might liquidate old LIFO layers... but this is FIFO/WAC. Okay, let's swap Statement 3 for something clearly false to make Option A the valid answer. Revised Statement 3: 'In a period of rising prices, LIFO results in higher ending inventory balances compared to FIFO.' (False, LIFO leaves old/cheap costs in inventory). Okay, I will modify the stem in the final output to ensure Statement 3 is incorrect. New Statement 3: 'In a period of rising prices, the LIFO method results in a higher Ending Inventory balance compared to the FIFO method.' Correct analysis: Rising prices. LIFO sells new (expensive). Ending Inventory is old (cheap). FIFO sells old (cheap). Ending Inventory is new (expensive). So LIFO Ending Inventory < FIFO Ending Inventory. Thus, Statement 3 is False. This makes Option A (1, 2, 4) the distinct correct answer."

The matching principle requires estimating expected losses and recording them in the same period the revenue was generated, not waiting until the default occurs. Statement (2) is correct. The allowance method estimates bad debts (e.g., as a % of sales or receivables) and records a Bad Debt Expense and an increase to the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (a contra-asset) in the period of sale. This aligns expense recognition with revenue recognition. Statement (3) is incorrect. This is a common tricky concept. When a specific account is written off, you debit the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and credit Accounts Receivable. Both are asset accounts (one contra). The gross receivable goes down, and the contra-asset (allowance) goes down (becomes less negative). The net effect on 'Net Accounts Receivable' (Gross AR - Allowance) is zero. The expense was already recognized earlier when the allowance was created. Statement (4) is correct. If a company increases its estimate of bad debts, it records a higher Bad Debt Expense. Higher expense = Lower Net Income. It also increases the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (contra-asset), which reduces the Net Accounts Receivable (an asset). Lower Asset = Lower Total Assets.

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Netting vs. Gross Interest Capitalization</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> This question tests the specific difference in how temporary investment income is treated during capitalization.</p><p><strong>Total Interest Incurred (Year 1):</strong> <br>$$ 2,000,000 \\times 5\\% = 100,000 $$</p><p><strong>US GAAP Treatment:</strong> <br>US GAAP requires capitalizing interest based on expenditures but does <strong>not</strong> allow netting of investment income earned on the idle borrowings. <br>Capitalizable Interest = Rate × Average Expenditures <br>$$ 5\\% \\times 800,000 = 40,000 $$ <br>Reported Interest Expense = Total Interest Incurred - Capitalized Interest <br>$$ 100,000 - 40,000 = 60,000 $$</p><p><strong>IFRS Treatment:</strong> <br>IFRS requires that the interest cost capitalized be the actual borrowing costs incurred less any investment income on the temporary investment of those borrowings. <br>Borrowing Costs (Gross) = 40,000 (Calculated same way as limit: limited to actual costs related to the asset). <br>Wait, let's refine the IFRS rule application for 'specific borrowings'. The loan is specific to the project. <br>Under IFRS (IAS 23), capitalization is: Actual borrowing costs incurred on specific borrowings minus investment income on temporary investment of those borrowings. <br>Surplus Cash in Year 1: <br>Average Expenditures = 800,000. Average Surplus = 2,000,000 (Loan) - 800,000 (Used) = 1,200,000. <br>Investment Income = 1,200,000 × 2% = 24,000. <br>Capitalized Amount = Actual Interest on Borrowing - Investment Income <br>$$ 100,000 - 24,000 = 76,000 $$ <br>Wait, the *amount to be capitalized* is the net cost. <br>However, standard interpretation: You capitalize the net cost *up to* the expenditures? No, for specific borrowings, you capitalize the net cost incurred during the period the asset is being prepared. <br>Let's re-verify: 'To the extent that funds are borrowed specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the entity shall determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation as the actual borrowing costs incurred on that borrowing during the period less any investment income on the temporary investment of those borrowings.' <br>So Capitalized Interest (IFRS) = 100,000 (Total Cost) - 24,000 (Income) = 76,000. <br>Reported Interest Expense (IFRS) = Total Incurred - Capitalized. <br>Total Incurred is still 100,000. <br>So Reported Expense = 100,000 - 76,000 = 24,000.</p><p><strong>Difference:</strong> <br>US GAAP Expense: 60,000 <br>IFRS Expense: 24,000 <br>Difference = 36,000. <br>Wait, my options are A: 0, B: 16,000, C: 24,000. <br>Let me re-read the US GAAP capitalization rule. Capitalized interest = Average Accumulated Expenditures × Rate. <br>Expenditures = 800,000. Rate = 5%. Capitalized = 40,000. <br>Expense = 100,000 - 40,000 = 60,000. <br>Investment income of 24,000 is reported as Interest Income (separate line), not netted against Interest Expense. <br>So Net Interest Expense line item: 60,000.</p><p>Re-evaluating IFRS: <br>Capitalized Interest = 100,000 - 24,000 = 76,000. <br>Reported Interest Expense on P&L = 100,000 (Total Incurred) - 76,000 (Capitalized) = 24,000. <br>Difference = 60,000 - 24,000 = 36,000. <br>This is not an option. Let me check if 'expenditures' limits the capitalization in IFRS for specific borrowings. <br>No, for specific borrowings, it's the net cost. <br>Did I miscalculate the investment income? Average surplus. If average carrying amount is 800,000, implies average usage is 800,000. Average surplus = 1,200,000. Correct. <br>Let's look at option B (16,000). 40,000 - 24,000? <br>Maybe the question assumes the IFRS capitalization is limited to the rate * expenditures? No, that's general borrowings. <br>Let's assume the question asks for the difference in *Capitalized Amount*. <br>US GAAP Capitalized: 40,000. <br>IFRS Capitalized: 76,000. <br>Difference: 36,000. Still not 16,000. <br>Let's reconsider the average expenditure. <br>Maybe the IFRS calculation is: Capitalized = (Expenditures * Rate) - Investment Income? No, that mixes logic. <br>Let's try: US GAAP Expense = 60k. IFRS Expense = 24k. <br>Is it possible the question implies 'Impact on Net Income'? <br>US GAAP: Interest Exp (60k) - Interest Inc (24k) = Net Cost 36k. <br>IFRS: Interest Exp (24k). Net Cost 24k. <br>Diff in Net Income = 12k. <br>Let's adjust the question numbers to fit an option or create a new clear path. <br><strong>Revised Stem Numbers:</strong> Loan 1,000,000 @ 10%. Avg Expenditures 600,000. Return on cash 4%. <br>US GAAP: Capitalized = 600k * 10% = 60k. Total Int = 100k. Expensed = 40k. <br>IFRS: Specific borrowing. Interest = 100k. Inv Income = (1m - 600k)*4% = 16k. Capitalized = 100k - 16k = 84k. Expensed = 100k - 84k = 16k. <br>Difference in Expense: 40k - 16k = 24k. <br>This matches Option C.</p><p><strong>Updated Stem in JSON:</strong> <br>Loan 1,000,000 @ 10%. Avg Expenditures 600,000. Cash Return 4%. <br>Question: Difference in reported Interest Expense.</p><p><strong>C is correct.</strong> <br><strong>US GAAP:</strong> <br>$$ \\text{Capitalized} = 600,000 \\times 10\\% = 60,000 $USD  <br>$ \\text{Expensed} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 $$ <br><strong>IFRS:</strong> <br>$$ \\text{Inv Income} = (1,000,000 - 600,000) \\times 4\\% = 16,000 $USD  <br>$ \\text{Capitalized} = 100,000 - 16,000 = 84,000 $USD  <br>$ \\text{Expensed} = 100,000 - 84,000 = 16,000 $$ <br><strong>Difference:</strong> <br>$$ 40,000 - 16,000 = 24,000 $$</p><p>A is incorrect because standards differ on netting investment income. <br>B is incorrect (Calculation trap).</p>"
