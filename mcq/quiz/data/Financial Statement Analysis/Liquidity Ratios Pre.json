    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Cash Conversion Cycle Identity</h3><p><strong>C is correct.</strong> The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) represents the net time interval between cash outflows for inputs and cash inflows from sales. The governing relationship is: $$CCC = DSO + DOH - \\text{Days Payables}$$. This equation balances the asset side (receivables and inventory requiring funding) against the liability side (payables providing funding). Rearranging the formula to solve for the unknown variable (Days Payables): $$\\text{Days Payables} = DSO + DOH - CCC$$. Substituting the provided values: $$\\text{Days Payables} = 32 + 18 - (-15)$$. $$\\text{Days Payables} = 50 + 15 = 65\\text{ days}$$.</p><p>A is incorrect: This result arises from incorrectly subtracting the absolute value of the CCC without regarding the double negative, or effectively solving $32 + 18 - 15$.</p><p>B is incorrect: This result arises from ignoring the CCC term entirely or simply summing the asset days ($32 + 18$).</p>"

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Liquidity Stress vs. Efficiency</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> While a negative Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is generally viewed as favorable (indicating the firm is financed by suppliers), the driver of the negative number determines the signal. In the National Datacomputer (NDC) case, the negative CCC was driven by a spike in accounts payable (delaying payments due to cash shortages) and a drop in inventory to zero (inability to purchase new stock). From a first-principles perspective, if the 'financing' (payables) grows only because the firm <em>cannot</em> pay, and the 'asset' (inventory) shrinks because the firm <em>cannot</em> buy, the negative cycle signals a liquidity crisis rather than leverage or efficiency. </p><p>A is incorrect: Just-in-time manufacturing reduces DOH, but it does not typically lead to a complete disappearance of inventory due to credit freezes, nor is it characterized by an inability to pay suppliers (spiking payables) as a primary feature.</p><p>C is incorrect: This describes the Apple scenario, where the firm <em>has</em> cash but chooses to use supplier credit. The NDC case is defined by a lack of cash.</p>"

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: The Time Value of Money in Working Capital</h3><p><strong>C is correct.</strong> A negative Cash Conversion Cycle implies that the company collects cash from customers <em>before</em> it is required to pay suppliers (Days Payables > DSO + DOH). Structurally, this means the suppliers are financing the company's operations. If the company also holds large cash reserves (as Apple does), it is not using supplier credit out of necessity (distress), but out of strategy. The firm essentially receives an interest-free loan from suppliers, allowing it to keep its own cash invested in interest-bearing short-term securities. </p><p>A is incorrect: A negative CCC reduces or eliminates the need for external working capital financing (equity or debt) because the operating cycle generates cash rather than consuming it.</p><p>B is incorrect: A negative CCC relies on <em>maximizing</em> the days payable (paying later), not paying immediately.

Inventory Turnover is calculated as $\\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}$. In the specific case of National Datacomputer (NDC), the text notes that ending inventories for 2008 and 2009 were reported as $0 million. If the ending inventory is zero, calculating Days of Inventory on Hand (DOH) based on ending inventory yields zero (as seen in the text where DOH = 0.00). If one attempts to calculate turnover using just the ending balance as the denominator, the expression becomes undefined (division by zero). Even with an average, a zero balance distorts the metric's economic meaning, signaling a stoppage of operations rather than 'infinite' efficiency.</p><p>A is incorrect: COGS was positive ($1.228 million) in 2009; the issue was the denominator (inventory).</p><p>C is incorrect: Sales were present ($1.723 million); the limitation was specific to the asset balance (inventory), not the flow variable (sales).</p>"

In the context of the provided text (National Datacomputer), such an extreme extension signals that the company is failing to pay its obligations on time due to a lack of cash ('stretching the payables'). It represents a default-like behavior rather than a negotiated term.</p><p>A is incorrect: While bargaining power allows for <em>better</em> terms (e.g., moving from 30 to 60 days), suppliers rarely agree to 295-day payment terms voluntarily. Such a duration implies non-payment/arrears.</p><p>B is incorrect: Improved creditworthiness might yield slightly longer terms, but extreme delays generally hurt creditworthiness, causing suppliers to cut off credit (as seen with NDC's inventory disappearance).</p>"
