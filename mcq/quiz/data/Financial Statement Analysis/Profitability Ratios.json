    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Components of Gross Profit</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Gross profit margin is calculated as (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue. An increase in this margin implies either Revenue increased relative to COGS, or COGS decreased relative to Revenue. If sales volume is constant, revenue growth comes from price. If prices rose more than unit costs (or unit costs fell), the margin expands. Scenario A describes a price increase outpacing cost inflation, directly widening the spread between price and direct cost.</p><p>B is incorrect: Administrative expenses are operating expenses, deducted <em>after</em> gross profit to reach operating profit. They do not affect gross profit margin.</p><p>C is incorrect: Marketing expenses are selling expenses (part of SG&A), which are also deducted below the gross profit line.

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: The Income Statement Cascade</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> Operating profit equals Gross Profit minus Operating Expenses (SG&A, R&D, etc.). If Gross Margin is stable, the ratio of Cost of Goods Sold to Sales is unchanged. A decline in Operating Margin therefore must stem from the \"wedge\" between Gross Profit and Operating Profit.
