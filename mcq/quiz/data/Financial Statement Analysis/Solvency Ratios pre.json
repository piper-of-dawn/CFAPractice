    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Solvency Metrics</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> The Debt-to-Capital ratio is calculated as Total Debt divided by (Total Debt + Total Equity).</p><p>1. <strong>Identify Total Debt:</strong> Solvency ratios typically focus on interest-bearing obligations. This includes Short-term interest-bearing debt, Long-term bonds, and Lease Liabilities.

Actually, if AP is included: (7200 / 15200 = 47%). Let's check B logic. Maybe Debt/Equity? 6000/8000 = 75%. No. If excluding leases: Debt=4500. Cap=12500. 36%. </p><p>C is incorrect. If leases are excluded from debt: Debt=4500. Total Cap=12500. Ratio = 36%. If ST debt excluded: 5500/13500 = 40.7%.</p><p>Wait, re-verifying A. 6000/14000 = 42.85%. Correct.</p>"
