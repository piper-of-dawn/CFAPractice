    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Identifiability–Control–Benefits</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> From first principles, an intangible asset can only be recognized when it represents a future economic resource the entity can both point to and control. IFRS embeds this logic through three criteria: identifiability (the asset is separable or arises from contractual/legal rights), control (the firm can restrict others’ access to the benefit), and probability of future economic benefits. If these conditions fail, the asset cannot be capitalized because it lacks the essential qualities of an economic resource. Applying this to the question, option B directly matches all three IFRS requirements.</p><p>A is incorrect because legal protection alone does not guarantee control or future benefits. A trademark can have a long legal life but still fail to meet recognition criteria if benefits are uncertain.</p><p>C is incorrect because internal development is not required for recognition; purchased intangible assets also qualify, and internally developed assets face additional research-versus-development hurdles.</p>"

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Observable Cost vs. Uncertain Creation</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Purchased intangibles have a clear, observable transaction price—making measurement straightforward—so capitalization is required. Internally developed assets do not have this external verification; early expenditures are uncertain and exploratory. IFRS therefore forces expensing during the research phase and allows capitalization only after technical feasibility and intent to complete are demonstrated in the development phase.

During research, outcomes are unknown, so expensing is required. Once feasibility and intent to complete are demonstrated, the expenditures contribute directly to constructing a future economic resource and can be capitalized. This reflects the core principle: capitalize only when value creation is sufficiently certain.</p><p>A is incorrect because research expenditures are inherently uncertain, exploratory, and lack evidence of future benefits.</p><p>C is incorrect because post-deployment maintenance preserves, not enhances, asset value and thus must be expensed as incurred.</p>"

Even under the same GAAP (IFRS or US GAAP), companies have choices, such as selecting different useful lives or depreciation methods (e.g., straight-line vs. double-declining balance).
