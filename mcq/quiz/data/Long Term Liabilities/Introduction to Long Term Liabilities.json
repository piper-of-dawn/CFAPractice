IFRS 16 applies a single lessee model: regardless of classification (operating or finance), the lessee recognizes a right-of-use (ROU) asset representing the right to use the leased asset and a corresponding lease liability representing the obligation to make future lease payments. Both are measured at the present value of lease payments at commencement. Subsequently, the lessee depreciates the ROU asset and recognizes interest expense on the liability using the effective interest method. This unified approach eliminates off-balance-sheet financing that existed under previous standards.</p><p>A is incorrect because it describes the old accounting model (pre-IFRS 16) where operating leases were not capitalized and were simply expensed.

For lessors, both frameworks retained the dual-model approach distinguishing between operating and finance (or sales-type) leases based on transfer of risks and rewards of ownership. The lessor either derecognizes the asset and recognizes a lease receivable (finance/sales-type lease) or keeps the asset on the books and recognizes rental income (operating lease). This treatment is substantially the same across both standards. However, for lessees, IFRS adopted a single model (all leases on-balance-sheet) while US GAAP maintained a dual model with distinct accounting for operating versus finance leases.</p><p>A is incorrect because it overstates differences—lessor accounting is substantially aligned between IFRS and US GAAP, not significantly different in either classification criteria or measurement approaches.</p><p>B is incorrect because while lessor accounting is very similar and shares the same treatment, the word identical is too strong given minor differences in disclosure requirements and implementation details between the standards.</p>"

Key advantages include: (1) lower initial cash outlay since the lessee doesn't purchase the asset, (2) potentially favorable financing terms, and (3) mitigation of obsolescence risk because the lessee can return the asset at lease end rather than bearing disposal/residual value risk. However, guaranteed residual value protection is not a standard feature—in fact, in most leases (especially operating leases), the lessor retains the residual value risk and benefit. Lessees typically do not receive residual value guarantees; they may face penalties if asset condition deteriorates below normal wear and tear, but protection and upside of residual value accrues to the lessor, not the lessee.</p><p>A is incorrect because lower upfront cash commitment is indeed a primary advantage of leasing—the lessee avoids the large capital expenditure required for outright purchase.</p><p>B is incorrect because transferring obsolescence risk to the lessor is a legitimate advantage, particularly relevant for technology or equipment with short useful lives where operating leases allow lessees to upgrade without bearing disposal concerns.</p>"

In a defined contribution plan, the employer's obligation is fixed—they contribute a specified amount per period. The ultimate pension benefit depends on investment returns on those contributions, which is uncertain. Thus, employees bear investment risk: if assets underperform, retirement income is lower. Conversely, in a defined benefit plan, the benefit amount is fixed by formula (e.g., percentage of final salary), so the employer must ensure sufficient assets exist to pay that promise.

In a defined benefit plan, the employer promises to pay a specific benefit amount for the retiree's lifetime. If retirees live longer than actuarial assumptions predict, the employer must make payments for more years than anticipated, increasing costs. The employer bears this risk because the benefit is defined—longer life means more total payments from the employer's perspective. In a defined contribution plan, the employee receives an account balance; if they live longer, they must stretch that balance across more years, but the employer has no further obligation beyond the original contributions. Thus, employees in DC plans bear longevity risk.</p><p>A is incorrect because while employees in defined contribution plans do bear longevity risk (outliving their assets), the question asks about actuarial risk as defined in pension accounting, which primarily affects the party making ongoing payments—the employer in DB plans.</p><p>C is incorrect because employers in defined contribution plans do not bear actuarial risk—their obligation is limited to the defined contribution amount regardless of when employees retire or how long they live.</p>"

In a defined contribution plan, the employer's obligation is simply to contribute a specified amount (e.g., 5% of salary) to employee accounts. Once contributed, the employer has no further obligation—employees own the assets and bear investment risk. Therefore, the accounting is straightforward: the cash payment made into the plan equals the pension expense for that period.

From liability classification principles, liabilities are current if expected to be settled within one year or the operating cycle.

Additionally, stock grants and options typically have vesting periods (e.g., 3-4 years), creating retention incentives—employees must stay to receive the benefit.

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Asset Derecognition and Receivable Recognition</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> When a lease transfers substantially all risks and rewards to the lessee (finance/sales-type lease), the lessor has economically sold the asset and provided financing. From the derecognition principle, the lessor removes the underlying asset from the balance sheet because control has transferred. In its place, the lessor recognizes a lease receivable equal to the present value of lease payments—representing the amount owed by the lessee. For a sales-type lease, the lessor also recognizes revenue (sales price) and cost of goods sold (carrying amount) at lease commencement, plus interest income over time as the receivable is collected. This mirrors a seller financing an asset purchase.</p><p>A is incorrect because this describes operating lease accounting by the lessor. In a finance/sales-type lease, the lessor derecognizes the asset and therefore does not record depreciation—the asset is off the books.</p><p>C is incorrect because straight-line rental income recognition is characteristic of operating leases where the lessor retains the asset. In finance leases, the lessor recognizes interest income on the lease receivable using the effective interest method, not rental income.</p>"

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Expected Vesting and Expense Allocation</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Stock-based compensation expense equals the grant-date fair value adjusted for expected forfeitures, allocated over the vesting period. Start with total compensation: $400,000 grant-date fair value. Apply expected forfeiture rate: if 10% are expected to forfeit, then 90% are expected to vest, so total expense = $400,000 × 0.90 = $360,000. Allocate over vesting period: $360,000 ÷ 4 years = $90,000 per year. In Year 1, the company recognizes $90,000 compensation expense. This reflects the matching principle—spreading the cost of employee service over the period employees earn the award, adjusted for the probability they will actually receive it.</p><p>B is incorrect because it fails to adjust for expected forfeitures, calculating $400,000 ÷ 4 = $100,000. The expected forfeiture rate must be incorporated to avoid overstating expense for options that will not vest.</p><p>C is incorrect because it misapplies the forfeiture adjustment, possibly adding rather than subtracting forfeitures. The correct approach reduces total expense by expected forfeitures since those options will not result in economic cost to the company.</p>"

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Investment Risk Attribution</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> In a defined benefit plan, the employer promises a specific retirement benefit (e.g., 60% of final salary for life). To fund this, the employer maintains plan assets invested in stocks, bonds, and other securities. If these assets underperform—due to market declines or poor investment choices—the plan becomes underfunded (assets < obligation). The employer must then contribute additional funds to ensure the promised benefits can be paid. This investment risk is substantial and unpredictable, potentially requiring large cash contributions in down markets. In contrast, defined contribution plans transfer investment risk to employees—the employer contributes a fixed amount and has no obligation if investments underperform.</p><p>A is incorrect because employee turnover risk affects both plan types and is not specifically greater for defined benefit plans. In fact, DB plans often have longer vesting periods and portability challenges, potentially creating retention benefits for employers rather than risks.</p><p>C is incorrect because regulatory vesting changes can affect both plan types. Moreover, in defined contribution plans, employee contributions (if any) are typically immediately vested since employees own their own contributions; employer contributions have vesting schedules. This is not a distinguishing risk for DB plans.</p>"
