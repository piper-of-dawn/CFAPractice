    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Transparency in Obligations</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> The fundamental principle of financial reporting is to provide users with information to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows. A maturity analysis of lease liabilities directly serves this purpose by breaking down the timing of future lease payments. IFRS 16 mandates this separation from other liabilities like bonds to prevent obscuring the unique nature and timing of lease obligations, thus enhancing transparency. This allows analysts to model the company's liquidity and solvency with greater precision.</p><p>A is incorrect because IFRS 16 requires the disclosure of the carrying amount of right-of-use assets *by class of underlying asset*, not aggregated. Aggregation would obscure important details about the nature of the company's leased assets (e.g., separating properties from vehicles), which is a key piece of information for analysis. This violates the principle of disaggregation for clarity.</p><p>C is incorrect. While the right-of-use asset is on the balance sheet, the lessee does not own the underlying asset and is not required to disclose its fair value. The focus for the lessee is on the liability and the right to use the asset, not the asset's market value, which is more relevant to the lessor. Requiring this would be an unnecessary and costly burden for the lessee.</p>"

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Lessor's Income Recognition</h3><p><strong>C is correct.</strong> A finance lease is economically equivalent to the lessor financing the purchase of an asset by the lessee. Therefore, the lessor's income statement should reflect the nature of this financing arrangement. The core components of earnings from a finance lease are the recovery of the asset's cost (or selling profit) and the interest earned on the financing provided. IFRS 16 requires the disclosure of 'finance income on the net investment in the lease' to make the interest revenue component of the lessor's earnings explicit, allowing for a clear analysis of its financing activities.</p><p>A is incorrect. IFRS 16 requires a maturity analysis for a minimum of each of the first *five* years, and a total for the remaining years. Limiting this to three years would provide an incomplete picture of the future cash inflows from the lease receivables, undermining the objective of assessing the timing and amount of future cash flows.</p><p>B is incorrect. This disclosure, total cash outflow for leases, is a requirement for the *lessee*, not the lessor. The lessor experiences cash *inflows* from lease payments.

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Risk and Obligation</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> In a defined contribution plan, the employer's obligation is fixed and is discharged by making the agreed-upon contributions to a separate entity. The risk of investment performance is borne entirely by the employee. From first principles, the only impact on the employer's financial statements is the contribution it makes, which is recognized as an expense in the period it is due.

A sensitivity analysis is a required disclosure for a *defined benefit* plan, where the employer bears the investment risk. For a defined contribution plan, the employer has no exposure to the plan's asset performance, so a sensitivity analysis is irrelevant from the employer's perspective.</p><p>C is incorrect.

Disclosing the plan's characteristics and associated risks is the first step in this process of enlightenment for the user.</p><p>B is incorrect. While assumptions about expected returns are used in calculating pension expense, IAS 19 does not require a multi-year forecast of these returns.

Separating lease and non-lease components (like maintenance services) can be complex and costly. IFRS 16 and US GAAP allow a practical expedient where a lessee can elect to combine these components and account for the entire payment as a single lease. This simplifies accounting without losing significant informational value, especially if the non-lease components are not material. This is a practical choice to reduce complexity.</p><p>A is incorrect. Ignoring non-lease components would understate the total obligation and expense related to the arrangement, violating the principle of full and fair disclosure. The payments for these services are real costs that must be accounted for.</p><p>C is incorrect. Capitalizing the non-lease components is fundamentally wrong.

The reconciliation of the net pension asset or liability tracks all the events that change its value over a period. The employer's contributions are a direct cash inflow to the plan, which increases plan assets and therefore reduces the net liability (or increases the net asset) of the plan on the company's balance sheet. This is a fundamental transaction between the sponsoring employer and the pension plan that must be tracked in the reconciliation.</p><p>A is incorrect. Dividends paid to shareholders are a distribution of the company's profits and are completely unrelated to the funding or obligations of the separate pension plan. Including this would be a conceptual error, mixing corporate financing activities with pension accounting.</p><p>C is incorrect. Corporate income tax payments are an expense of the company and a cash flow between the company and the government. They have no direct bearing on the financial position of the pension plan.

This term applies specifically to share options.</p><p>C is incorrect. While intrinsic value (market price less exercise price) is relevant for options, for instruments like RSUs, the value is simply the market price.

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Assessing Investment Risk</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> In a defined benefit plan, the employer bears the investment risk. To enable financial statement users to assess this risk, they need to understand how the plan's assets are invested. Disclosing the composition of assets by major category (equities, debt, real estate, etc.) allows an analyst to evaluate the plan's asset allocation strategy and its exposure to different market risks. This provides insight into the potential volatility of plan assets and the likelihood of future funding requirements for the employer.</p><p>A is incorrect. This level of detail is excessive and not required. The focus is on the overall asset allocation and risk profile, not on the individual securities. Disclosing every holding would be impractical and would not necessarily provide more useful information for most users.</p><p>C is incorrect. While historical returns are informative, they are not a required disclosure under IAS 19. The standard focuses on providing a forward-looking assessment of risk through disclosure of the asset allocation and sensitivity analyses, rather than a detailed history of past performance.</p>"

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Quantitative vs. Qualitative</h3><p><strong>C is correct.</strong> Financial disclosures are divided into quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (descriptive) information. A quantitative disclosure is a specific numerical value. The depreciation charge for right-of-use assets is a number, expressed in a currency (e.g., dollars or euros), that appears in the financial statements. It quantifies the allocation of the right-of-use asset's cost over its useful life. This is a clear example of a quantitative disclosure.</p><p>A is incorrect. A description of significant judgments is narrative and explains the reasoning behind accounting choices (e.g., determining the lease term when options are available). This is a qualitative disclosure, providing context and insight into the numbers, not the numbers themselves.</p><p>B is incorrect. A description of the nature of leasing activities is qualitative. It provides a narrative explanation of what the company leases and why, which gives context to the quantitative data but is not numerical itself.</p>"

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Tracking Equity Claims</h3><p><strong>C is correct.</strong> The purpose of the option reconciliation is to track the flow of potential claims on the company's equity. It allows analysts to model potential dilution. The number of options granted, exercised, forfeited, and expired are all activities that change the total number of options outstanding. The age of the employees holding these options, however, is a demographic detail that has no bearing on the number of options or their financial impact on the company. It is irrelevant to the accounting and disclosure principles of IFRS 2.</p><p>A is incorrect. The number of options granted is a fundamental component of the reconciliation, as it represents the new potential shares created during the period. It is a primary driver of the increase in options outstanding.</p><p>B is incorrect. The number of options exercised is also a fundamental component. It represents the conversion of options into actual shares, which is a key event for both cash flow (from the exercise price) and dilution. It is a primary driver of the decrease in options outstanding.</p>"
