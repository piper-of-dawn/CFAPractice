    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Start with the no-arbitrage condition: Forward Price = Spot Price × (1 + r)^T. Here, the theoretical forward should be roughly 104 (100 × 1.04). Since the market forward is 105, it is overpriced. To exploit an overpriced derivative, you must sell (short) it. To hedge the short forward position and lock in the profit, you must own the asset at maturity to deliver it. Therefore, you buy the asset today (spot). To fund this purchase without using your own capital (creating a pure arbitrage), you borrow the cash at the risk-free rate. At maturity, you deliver the asset for USD 105, repay the loan (USD 104), and keep the risk-free difference.</p><p>B is incorrect: This is a reverse cash-and-carry strategy.

Importantly, dividends paid <em>during</em> the life of the contract reduce the cost of carry, while dividends paid at expiration might or might not be included depending on the specific contract terms; however, standard forward pricing models deduct the PV of all dividends paid up to the expiration. If the dividend is paid 'just before' expiration, it is included.</p><p>Formula: $$ F_0(T) = [S_0 - PV(I)] (1+r)^T $$</p><p>1.

If $D_2$ is at T, its PV is $1.50/(1+r)^T$. But often $D_2$ is assumed to be received by the holder of the stock <em>before</em> delivery. If the forward holder does not receive $D_2$, it must be deducted. <br> Let's try the alternative method: $$ F_0(T) = S_0(1+r)^T - FV(I) $$ <br> $$ FV(D_1) = 1.50 \\times (1.04)^{0.5} = 1.50 \\times 1.0198 = 1.5297 $$ <br> $$ FV(D_2) = 1.50 $$ (paid at T) <br> $$ S_0(1+r)^T = 80 \\times 1.02985 = 82.388 $$ <br> $$ F_0(T) = 82.388 - 1.5297 - 1.50 = 79.358 $$ <br> Let's double check the calculation for Option B. Is it possible the question assumes only the first dividend is during the holding period? 'Just before expiration' usually implies the forward holder doesn't get it, so it's deducted. Let's check the math for B: $80 \\times 1.04^{0.75} - 1.50$. No. <br> Let's check if $D_2$ is NOT deducted (i.e. contract settles after dividend). If D2 is paid at T, and the forward settles at T, the stock price $S_T$ drops by D2. The forward prices $S_T$. So D2 is deducted. <br> Let's recalculate carefully. <br> $PV(D1) = 1.50 / 1.04^{0.25} = 1.485$. <br> $PV(D2) = 1.50 / 1.04^{0.75} = 1.457$. <br> Sum PV = 2.942. <br> $Net Spot = 77.058$. <br> $F = 77.058 * 1.04^{0.75} = 77.058 * 1.02985 = 79.36$. <br> Is there a simpler convention? Maybe $D_2$ is NOT deducted? If $D_2$ is at T, maybe it's not 'during' the life? But text says 'PV of benefits'. <br> Let's try: $S_0 = 80$, $PV(D_1) = 1.485$. Net = 78.515. <br> $F = 78.515 * 1.02985 = 80.86$. (Close to B/C). <br> Let's try: $PV(D_1)$ only. <br> $80 - 1.4853 = 78.5147$. <br> $78.5147 * 1.04^{0.75} = 80.86$. <br> Let's try Option B logic: $F = (S_0 - PV(D_1)) * (1+r)^T - D_2$? No. <br> Let's go with the result of removing ALL dividends. <br> Recalculation: $80(1.04)^{0.75} - 1.50(1.04)^{0.5} - 1.50 = 82.39 - 1.53 - 1.50 = 79.36$. <br> Wait, if $D_2$ is NOT deducted: $82.39 - 1.53 = 80.86$. <br> Let's check the text's Example 4. 'Dividend... occurs in exactly three months and again at time T...'. Text: 'PV0(I) = EUR0.30/(1.05)^0.25 + EUR0.30/(1.05)^0.5'. It sums BOTH. <br> Text Calculation: $PV = 0.5892$. $F = (50 - 0.5892)(1.05)^0.5 = 50.63$. <br> So the text deducts BOTH dividends. <br> My calculation: $F = 79.36$. <br> Let me adjust the options to match the correct calculation $79.36$. Or check if I made a mistake. <br> $80 * 1.02985 = 82.388$. <br> $PV(D1+D2) * 1.02985 = FV(D1+D2)$. <br> $FV(D1) = 1.53$. $FV(D2) = 1.50$. Sum = 3.03. <br> $82.388 - 3.03 = 79.358$. <br> Okay, I will set Option A to 79.36. <br> Wait, is it possible the rate is continuous? 'Discrete compounding' is stated. <br> Let's re-read carefully. Maybe risk-free rate is simple interest? $1 + r(t)$? <br> CFA Level 1 Derivatives usually uses discrete $(1+r)^T$. <br> Let's try simple interest for the period: $r_{period} = 0.04 * 0.75 = 0.03$. <br> $S_0(1.03) - 1.50(1+0.04*0.5) - 1.50$? <br> $80(1.03) - 1.50(1.02) - 1.50 = 82.4 - 1.53 - 1.50 = 79.37$. <br> Very close. Let's stick to $(1+r)^T$. Correct answer is approx 79.36. I will update Option A to 79.36 and mark it correct.</p>"
