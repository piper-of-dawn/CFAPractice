    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: How cost layers flow</h3><p><strong>B is correct.</strong> COGS reflects the cost assigned to the units a firm is assumed to have sold. Under LIFO in an inflationary environment, the newest purchases have the highest cost. These high-cost units are pulled into COGS immediately. This pushes expense recognition upward, reducing gross profit. The PDF's Company L (LIFO) example shows systematically higher COGS compared with FIFO because each year's purchases rise by 4%.

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Timing of cost recognition</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> FIFO expends the oldest inventory costs first. In inflation, those older costs are cheaper than current ones. By keeping expensive layers in ending inventory, FIFO defers inflationary cost recognition and reports a lower COGS figure. Because profit = sales − COGS, lower COGS yields higher income. As shown in the PDF's Company F (FIFO) example, income and gross margins exceed those of Company L (LIFO) when prices rise. Memory hook: <em>“FIFO floats profits upward in inflation.”</em></p><p>B is incorrect because FIFO delays the recognition of newer, higher costs.</p><p>C is incorrect because income is affected by <em>timing</em> of COGS recognition, even though the total pool of cost is identical across methods.</p>"

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Turnover = COGS ÷ Ending Inventory</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> Turnover rises when COGS increases relative to ending inventory. Under LIFO with inflation, COGS is high (new expensive layers), while ending inventory is valued at old, low historical costs. This gives a large numerator and small denominator, producing a higher turnover ratio. The PDF's tables confirm this pattern across all five years.

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Raiding cheap layers</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> LIFO liquidation occurs when a firm sells more units than it purchases. Once recent layers are exhausted, the firm must expense older layers that were acquired at lower costs. This reduces COGS and artificially inflates gross profit. The PDF emphasizes this rising-profit effect when older layers are released.

    "explanation": "<h3>First Principles Thinking: Matching current cost with current price</h3><p><strong>A is correct.</strong> LIFO assigns current, inflation-adjusted costs to COGS. Selling prices also rise each year. When cost and price grow at the same rate, the gross margin ratio (price minus cost divided by price) remains stable. The PDF’s Company L shows flat margins for this reason.
