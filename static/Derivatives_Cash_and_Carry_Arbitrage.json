Payoff at T: S_T – S₀e^{rT} (asset value minus loan repayment). Futures delivers S_T for F₀, so no-arbitrage requires F₀ = S₀e^{rT} (continuous). Discrete: F₀(1+r)^T = S₀(1+r)^T + carrying costs.

To unwind, buy futures at F* such that F* = current spot e^{r remaining} = 105 e^{0.05×(2/3)} ≈ 108.528, but to keep profit, close position so net cash flows preserve. Standard: initial profit = F₀ – S₀ e^{rT}. To lock same profit early, sell new futures at fair value based on current spot. But question asks closing futures price to lock same NPV. Correct calc: original locked revenue 109 at T=1. After 4 months, close by buying futures at F_close, receive (109 – F_close) at t=1/3, invest to T=1: (109 – F_close) e^{0.05×(2/3)}.
