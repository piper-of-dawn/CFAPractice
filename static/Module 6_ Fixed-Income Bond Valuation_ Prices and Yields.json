		"correct_answer": "B",
		"explanation": "B is correct. Current yield measures **cash income divided by capital invested**, isolating the income component of return. It ignores time value and redemption gain/loss but still follows the value principle: yield must rise when price falls. 8 ÷ 95 = 8.42%.\nA is incorrect; using the coupon rate assumes price equals par and ignores that investors here pay less than face value.\nC is incorrect; 9% exaggerates because the inverse relation between yield and price is not one-for-one—current yield scales linearly with price, not exponentially as YTM does."

			"A": "95.24",
			"B": "90.70",
			"C": "110.25"
		},
		"correct_answer": "B",
		"explanation": "B is correct. A zero-coupon bond has a single cash flow—its face value—so price must equal that payment discounted by the compound factor (1 + r)^T. Price = 100 / (1.05)^2 = 90.70. This directly expresses the first principle of valuation: **value today = future cash flow ÷ growth of a dollar.**\nA is incorrect; it discounts only one year of growth, ignoring compounding.\nC is incorrect; it represents the future value of 100, not the present value."

		},
		"correct_answer": "A",
		"explanation": "A is correct. Duration is the **first derivative of price with respect to yield**, showing proportional sensitivity. The approximation ΔP/P ≈ −D_mod × Δy follows directly from differentiating the present-value formula. Substituting: −4.2 × 0.005 = −2.10%. The negative sign arises because a higher discount rate lowers the present value of future cash flows.\nB is incorrect; it ignores that yield change must be expressed as a decimal fraction.\nC is incorrect; it uses the yield change itself as the price change, confusing inputs with outcomes."

		"options": {
			"A": "YTM > Current Yield > Coupon Rate",
			"B": "Coupon Rate > Current Yield > YTM",
			"C": "Current Yield > Coupon Rate > YTM"
		},
		"correct_answer": "B",
		"explanation": "B is correct. From first principles, a bond’s total return (YTM) must equate price to discounted cash flows. When price exceeds par, investors pay extra today for future cash flows that are fixed—implying the discount rate used (YTM) must be lower than the coupon rate that generated those flows. Current yield lies between the two because it considers only cash income, not the amortization of the premium. Thus CR > CY > YTM.\nA is incorrect; that ordering applies to a discount bond, where the market demands extra yield.\nC is incorrect; current yield cannot exceed the coupon rate because the denominator (price) is greater than par."

			"B": "1.75",

		},
		"correct_answer": "A",
		"explanation": "A is correct. Interest accrues linearly with time because each day represents an equal fraction of the coupon-earning period. Semiannual coupon = 3.50 per 100; accrued = 3.50 × (45/180) = 0.875. This reflects the fundamental time-value idea: value accumulates with the passage of time proportionally to the rate and period.\nB is incorrect; 1.75 assumes the entire semiannual coupon has accrued.\nC is incorrect; 0.70 corresponds to 20% of the period (36 days), not 25%."

The holding-period return applies the core finance identity: **Return = (Income + Price Change) ÷ Initial Investment.** It reflects total wealth growth relative to cost. HPR = (6 + (100 − 99)) / 99 = 7.07%. This unites both the time-value (coupon) and price-reversion (capital gain) effects in a single realized measure.\nA is incorrect; it omits the capital appreciation.\nC is incorrect; it understates return by dividing by par instead of the actual purchase price."
