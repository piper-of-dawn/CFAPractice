Deferred taxes arise when?,A temporary difference exists between carrying amount and tax base that will reverse in the future.
What creates a DTL?,Taxable temporary difference that pushes taxable income to the future → future tax payments ↑.
What creates a DTA?,Deductible temporary difference that pulls taxable income into the present → future tax payments ↓.
Do permanent differences create deferred taxes?,No permanent differences never reverse and create no DTL or DTA.
Effect of permanent differences on ratios?,They change the effective tax rate but do not affect deferred tax balances.
CA > TB for an asset means what?,Taxable temporary difference → DTL ↑.
CA < TB for an asset means what?,Deductible temporary difference → DTA ↑.
CA > TB for a liability means what?,Deductible temporary difference → DTA ↑.
CA < TB for a liability means what?,Taxable temporary difference → DTL ↑.
Why does accelerated tax depreciation create DTL?,Tax depreciation ↑ today → taxable income ↓ today → postponed taxes → DTL ↑.
How do advance payments affect deferred taxes?,Taxed now but not in accounting → TB > CA → DTA ↑.
How do warranty provisions affect deferred taxes?,Accounting expense now tax deduction later → CA < TB → DTA ↑.
Why do loss carryforwards create DTAs?,Future taxable income can be offset → future tax payments ↓ → DTA ↑.
When is a valuation allowance needed?,When the company may not generate enough taxable income to use the DTA.
Effect of higher valuation allowance?,Valuation allowance ↑ → DTA ↓ → tax expense ↑.
Income tax expense formula?,Tax expense = Taxes payable + ΔDTL − ΔDTA.
Effect of DTL increasing on tax expense?,ΔDTL ↑ → tax expense ↑.
Effect of DTA increasing on tax expense?,ΔDTA ↑ → tax expense ↓.
Effect of DTL reversal on cash taxes?,DTL ↓ → cash taxes ↑ because postponed taxes are paid now.
Effect of DTA reversal on cash taxes?,DTA ↓ → cash taxes ↓ because prepaid taxes reduce current payments.
When is a DTL considered equity like?,When it is not expected to reverse because it perpetually rolls forward.
How does equity like DTL affect ratios?,Treated as equity → leverage ↓.
How does real DTL affect valuation?,Treated as a liability → future cash outflows ↑.
Effect of deferred taxes on FCFF?,Remove noncash deferred tax expense → FCFF ↑ when DTL ↑ or DTA ↓.
